Out for revenge after being humiliated by the high-school duo, Death kidnaps their "medieval babe" girlfriends from the first film, and drags them throughout history.  Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.<br><br>Playing as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor.  Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin' guitar solo.  If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.<br><br>Other items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future.  Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that "they" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game's puzzles.<br><br>A password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player's progress.

You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... <br><br>The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. <br><br>Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. <br><br>The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

There is also a fight penalty system where you have to continually punch the an opponent in order to proceed. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective as if you were sat in one of the crowd seats.

It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.<br><br>Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.<br><br>Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. <br><br>Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.<br><br>The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as "transdimensional intruders," and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading "Sinlendo Techmods."  <br><br>The primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components.  The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, "our dimension's reactor."  As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine.  To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you’re meandering through this simulator on the “famous Atarian Leisure Moon.”  <br><br>Stages are fairly small, but designed like a maze à la Metroid.  However, unlike Metroid, completed areas cannot be revisited.  Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high.<br><br>Redd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the "Tmat MOW."  Tmat MOW is intended to be short for “TRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon.”  Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard.  Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like.  Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons.  Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected.  As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots.  Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned.  Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd.<br><br>Controlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them.  Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight.  Tapping "up" on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding "up" activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly.  Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn't a luxury to be wasted.  When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead.<br><br>Pressing the "Option 2" button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons.  If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters.<br><br>The player starts with three lives, and there are no continues.  There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard—which may be selected prior to gameplay.

While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing.

The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

Description=Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game or an unusually complex coin-op shoot 'em up, depending on your point of view. With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.<br><br>The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.
