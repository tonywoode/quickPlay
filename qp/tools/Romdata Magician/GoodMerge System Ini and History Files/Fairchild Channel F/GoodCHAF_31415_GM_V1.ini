Description=Although the title of the game may lead players to believe it's a pinball game, in actuality it is a game more heavily inspired by Breakout. The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points with the low green bricks being worth 1 point each, the middle blue bricks being worth 4 points each, and the red bricks on top being worth 7 points each. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, its up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. The player loses a life if they happen to miss a ball with their paddle and the ball falls into the abyss. The game ends when the player loses 7 balls. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side that the ball can bounce off of are labeled side rails, and the paddle is referred to as a flipper.<br><br>The game offers 132 game variations of this basic gameplay idea. <br>Games modes include Pinball Wiz, Crossover, Blok-Shot, Cooperation, Pro Challenge,  and Double Blok with each having variations which can include different sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even a variation where the paddle shrinks each time the ball is hit.

Players pilot a lunar lander and attempt to have a soft landing on a landing platform. The lunar lander only has a certain amount of fuel to maneuver around with thus adding to the challenge. The key is to have a soft landing by gently and smoothly lowering the lander onto the platform, as landing coming down too fast or missing the platform entirely crashes the lunar lander. Their is also a timer keeping count of the amount of time it takes for the player to land the lunar lander. The objective is to land the craft in the least amount of time possible.

The goal is to try to shoot down your opponent to score a point, and the player with the most points wins. Viewed from the side, your bi-planes have the freedom to fly anywhere on the screen; the screen wraps, so if you fly off of one side you will appear again on the other side. You can also hide just off screen to attempt to sneak up on an opponent; be careful, even though you may not be visible you are still vulnerable to attacks! The game can be played by two players against each other, or one player against the computer. When playing against the computer, the computer's skill level will vary throughout the game; the more times you are successful in shooting down the computer, the more its skill level will increase!

Description=Videocart-5: Space War is an action game where two players each control spaceships. The goal is to destroy your opponents ship by depleting its energy supply; success will earn you a point. Each ship is capable of flying anywhere on the screen and is also equipped with lasers for attacking your opponent. At the beginning of the game each spaceship has 90 energy units; when no energy is left that  ship will be destroyed. Energy can be depleted in two ways: 2 points are used up every time you fire your lasers, and 5 points are lost if hit by enemy laser fire. Should your energy level drop to 10 points or less, you will be unable to fire your lasers; this prevents you from accidentally obliterating your own spaceship! Energy units can be replenished by flying through one of the two starbases located at opposite ends of the screen.
