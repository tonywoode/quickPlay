007 - The World is Not Enough (c) Oct 17, 2000 Eurocom Entertainment Software / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
007: The World is Not Enough is a James Bond game based on the 1999 movie of the same name.  Both 
game and film follow Bond's investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon's new pipeline, while 
the game introduces new areas and backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that 
employs gadgets and gunplay. With each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives 
outlined in a pre-mission briefing. 
 
In contrast to the PlayStation title of the same name, this version is structured more like a 
successor to Rare's GoldenEye 007. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent, 
Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to 
each mission. An "Awards" system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes 
for beating target times for single-player levels. 
 
The game includes a local, split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players, or a combination of 
computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken from single-player mode, while others are exclusive 
to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill, Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent 
Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from GoldenEye 007, and retains its one-shot-kill 
power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a multiplayer match.

AeroFighters Assault (c) Nov 01, 1997 Paradigm Entertainment Inc. / Video System U.S.A., Inc. 
 
In AeroFighters Assault a terrorist organisation named Phutta Morgana has melted the Antarctic and 
uses the water to flood earth's cities. The player takes a part in the Project Blue unit which has to 
stop these terrorist acts. 
 
Regarding gameplay, the game is a mix between a regular shooter like Star Fox 64 and a simulation 
like Pilotwings 64: the player observes the action from behind the aircraft and uses the analog stick 
to dodge and the other buttons to shoot enemies. Each of the eight planes (six regular and two bonus) 
features different four weapons: two have unlimited ammo, air mines and the special weapon are 
restricted to ten respectively two uses per round. Before every of the eight regular and four bonus 
missions the player can choose between one of four characters and his aircraft - the other ones 
become his wingmen.

In the tradition of F-Zero and Wipeout, AeroGauge is a sci-fi racer that pits you and a friend in a 
fast paced race to the finish through futuristic tracks and among detailed craft, acting more like 
planes than racers as they skim many metres above the ground. Play solo through the grand prix and 
compete against the AI enemy, or beat down your best time in the time trial mode. 
 
Each track features a number of twists and turns, whether it be racing upside down or vertically, 
with a number of obstacles in your path. There's no weapons, though, it's just you and the open road 
ahead.

Aidyn Chronicles - The First Mage (c) Mar 01, 2000 H2O Entertainment / THQ Inc. 
 
Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage follows the story of Alaron, poisoned by mysterious goblins while 
out on patrol in the grounds of King Loyd's kingdom. Without a common cure, Alaron must set out on a 
journey with a selection of companions in search of the antidote. Little does Alaron know that the 
journey is even more dangerous then first thought, with a mysterious evil force brewing in the 
distance. 
 
A 3D fantasy role playing game, you must complete a set of quests, through the use of items and 
magic, while following a slightly non-linear storyline, in which you choose in what order the tasks 
can be completed. The game features two distinctive different modes: exploring and fighting. Alaron 
explores the game world freely, discover special places and talk to its inhabitants. There are no 
random encounters but if he meets an enemy the game switches to the combat screen. Combat is 
basically turn based but not in the usual console RPG way: during a character's turn he can be moved 
in real-time in a circular way - the characters move constantly towards each other. When two rings 
intersect the characters can launch a regular or magic attack. The party selection (up to four 
characters) is pre-defined by the story.

Airboarder 64 (c) Mar 27, 1998 Human Entertainment, Inc. / Human Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Air Boarder is a game that resembles skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater but with a 
certain aspect of it being quite different. Instead of the usual skateboards the game features hoover 
boards. 
 
1 Player option features the following modes: 
 
1. Lecture – mode where you can learn the controls and the terms the game uses. 
 
2. Street Work – the main mode of the game. At the beginning there are 4 available characters 
   (total of 8), 5 stages and 4 boards (total of 12) from which you can choose. At each stage you are 
   given a time limit in which you must perform as many tricks as possible with your board. There are 
   also yellow circles lying around that you must pass through. Each time you pass through one the 
   timer resets back and if you pass through all the game ends regardless of how much time is left. 
   When the game ends you get a rank depending on the points you accumulated and if the rank is high 
   enough a level of higher difficulty is unlocked (with a total of 3 difficulty levels per stage). 
 
3. Time Attack – you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within 
   the least time possible. The spots where the circles are can be seen via a map that appears on the 
   screen. 
 
4. Coin – mode in which you must get all the coins that are scattered on each stage within the 
   time limit. 
 
5. Free Run – this mode is free of challenges (no time limit or points) and mostly serves as a 
   means of getting you acquainted with each stage. 
 
2 Players option features the following modes: 
 
1. Vs. Race – 2 Player race where the one that passes through all of the yellow circles, in the 
   order that is specified wins. 
 
6. Vs. Coin – another 2 Player mode where the player who gets all the coins or has the most when 
   the time limit ends wins.

One morning Sarge is resting in his cot when the Tan launch a surprise attack on the Green base.  
Sarge and the Colonel are forced to retreat just as the base is overrun.  But in the chaos, Sarge's 
entire team of elite soldiers has been kidnapped by the Tan.  Worse yet, the Tan have made an amazing 
discovery: blue portals that lead to the real world!  They use these portals to take amazing weapons 
of war from the real world into the plastic world including magnifying glasses, deadly robot action 
figures, and fire crackers.  Its up to you, as Sarge, to rescue your team and put an end to the blue 
portals and Tan's evil schemes. 
 
Control Sarge in this Army Man third-person shooter.  You will wage war across Tan-infested 
territories, both in the real and plastic world. Make Sarge proud as you battle the Tan army across 
14 levels, utilizing 13 unique weapons like sky rockets and spray cans. Fight against not only 
infantrymen, tanks, and helicopters, but also killer toy robots and insects.  This third game in the 
Army Men series adds several new features, including 3DO's unique Plastosheen lighting effects, which 
give the army men a real-life plastic shine. 
 
Also included is a multiplayer mode.  Choose your character and even your color and duke it out with 
your friends.  You can choose from many different weapons and battle each other in areas from the 
game or exclusive multiplayer levels.  Even incorporated is the portal system, where you can enter 
blue portals and come out anywhere in the level.

Banjo-Kazooie (c) May 31, 1998 Rare, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Banjo-Kazooie's fairy tale back story is reminiscent of Snow White's. A gnarled, ugly witch named 
Gruntilda asks her magical cauldron who is the fairest of them all. Of course, the pot's answer 
doesn't please the hag-- he singles out Banjo's sister, Tooty. When Tooty turns up missing, Banjo and 
his birdie buddy Kazooie set out to find her. 
 
The worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are gigantic, and chock full of crazy items to collect. Musical Notes, 
Puzzle Pieces ("Jiggies"), Mumbo Tokens, and Jinjoes are just some of the swag that Banjo must stuff 
in his backpack to complete his adventure. While some of the necessary items are simply stashed off 
the beaten path, others will require puzzle solving skills to turn up.

Banjo-Tooie (c) Nov 20, 2000 Rare, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
After two years under the rock, Gruntilda is finally set free from her death bed by her two sisters. 
As nothing but a skeleton, Grunty and her sisters plan a way of curing her looks by sucking the life 
out of the land so as to restore her body to its old self. On hearing this news, our two champs Banjo 
and Kazooie with the aid of Mumbo set out to stop the evil plan and seek revenge for the passing away 
of Bottles the mole. 
 
In this sequel to Banjo-Kazooie, you can play as the two main characters (as well as Mumbo) just like 
before, although they can now separate, helping them get to even harder areas of the land. You must 
collect jiggies to open new areas (much like the original) as well as learn 40 new moves to help you 
get along. 
 
And much like another Rareware title, Donkey Kong 64, you can play four-player minigames that range 
from first-person shooters, bumper cars, battle for points, etc..

BassMasters 2000 (c) Dec 16, 1999 Mass Media, Inc. / THQ Inc. 
 
BassMasters 2000 is a fishing simulation game which counts a total of  4 modes and has a wide variety 
of customizable options. You can create and save up to 7 anglers through the “Create Angler” option 
and customize stats such as sex, hair, face, clothes, etc. Other customizable options include “Lake 
Conditions” (lake location, season, weather, time, etc.), “Boat” (boat model, engine, etc.) and 
“Tackle” (rod/reel, line, lure, etc.). These are the following modes: 
 
1. Exhibition - the only mode where every customizable option is available. The objective is to 
   catch up to a certain number of fish and the sum of their weight to equal or surpass the weight 
   that is mentioned in the beginning of the mode. 
 
2. Tournament - there are 6 tournaments you must compete in and each tournament lasts for 3 days. 
   Fishing lasts until the day is over at the end of which the total weight of fish caught is counted 
   and depending on how well you did you get the equivalent rank. If at the end of the last 
   tournament you manage to rank 5th or higher place new equipment and boats are unlocked. 
 
3. Speed Fishing - in this mode you’re given a time limit of 3 minutes and must catch as more of 
   the fish mentioned in the overview as possible. Time is extended by one second depending on how 
   much the fish weighs and the objective is to fish for as long as you can. 
 
4. Casting Game - you must cast the line at certain spots on the lake which are specified by 
   coloured circles within the time limit. With each target you manage to hit you receive points and 
   if the points that are accumulated are high enough you get additional time and the patterns in 
   which the targets appear change.

Batman Beyond - Return of the Joker (c) Dec 01, 2000 Kemco / Ubi Soft Entertainment Software 
 
Based off the movie, Batman Beyond puts the player on the streets of Gotham (Beyond) to take out the 
ever-grinning Joker, but before that an obvious long line of his evil minions - some of which are 
genetically engineered. 
 
Scroll around, punch, kick, play with bat-weapons, and avoid being on the receiving end of those 
attacks. There are multiple 'bat suits' that you can choose from, each with their own special 
abilities and purposes. 
 
Mostly a 3-D beat-the-living-sunshine-out-of-whatever-moves type.

Big Mountain 2000 (c) 2000 Genki Co., Ltd. / SouthPeak Interactive, LLC 
 
Big Mountain 2000 is a sports game where you can choose to race with either a snowboard or a ski. 
There are six characters (plus three unlockables) to choose from, each with different skills and 
three modes in total – two of them are single player and the other one is a multiplayer. 
 
1. Championship: in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style 
   you want – ski or snowboard.  You can also change each player’s equipment which includes 
   ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and 
   the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options – Free Ride, Slalom and Giant 
   Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you must finish first and before 
   time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass 
   through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish 
   first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the later’s course being wider and the 
   flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering, 
   acceleration, etc. are increased. 
 
2. 2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant 
   Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved 
   player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will 
   choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder. 
 
3. Time Attack: there are no other competitors in this mode – just you racing against time.

Blast Corps (c) Mar 31, 1997 Rare, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Get out of the way!  A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless 
that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the 
world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier. 
 
Blast Corps is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each 
level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits, trucks, or bulldozers), and 
are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy 
any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty 
increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes 
its not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the 
path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The 
Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the 
next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered 
throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and 
it's your job to ensure that it does! 
 
Blast Corps features many secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go 
back to a level once ts over to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must 
also find RDU's (Radiation Dispersal Units) which light up on the ground when the player is in close 
proximity to them. Players must also destroy all of the buildings, and rescue all of the homeless 
civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are 
also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes 
hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive 
a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for 
them...

Bomberman 64 (c) Dec 01, 1997 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The inhabitants of Bomber World have a unique philosophy of life: if something gets in the way, blow 
it up. Now you, too, can join in the fun with Hudson Soft's Bomberman 64. 
 
In Bomberman 64's all-new one-player Adventure mode, marauders have set their sights on Bomberman's 
peaceful planet. You'll explore labyrinthine levels by dropping bombs, solving puzzles and finding 
hidden items. The action takes place across five brightly colored worlds: a smoldering volcano, 
ruined castle, icy mountain range, orbiting space station and storybook village. Find all 100 Gold 
Cards in the first five worlds and you can access a sixth world. 
 
To maximize your score, you'll need to finish each of the 20 levels as quickly as possible. Deadlines 
are tighter on the Hard difficulty setting. Despite the prevalence of incendiary devices, Bomberman 
64's overhead perspective, cartoon-like graphics and bright palette gives the game the cheerful feel 
of Super Mario RPG. 
 
It's Bomberman 64's multiplayer mode, though, that really blows the socks off the pyrotechnicians at 
Power Source. In Single Battle mode, dashing about the baffling arenas and blowing each other to 
smithereens proves to be, well, a blast. Team Battle mode is a highly explosive version of 
capture-the-flag. Your goal here is to destroy the enemy team's gems while protecting your own. 
 
You can choose the number and duration of battles. You can also choose from three levels of 
artificial intelligence for CPU-controlled bombers. When the Ghost option is selected, your little 
guy will return as a wispy double of his old self after he's gone boom. Ghosts can control a normal 
Bomberman, but they cannot deploy bombs. 
 
You'll savor Bomberman 64's sneaky new features, including extremely high explosives and the ability 
to toss or kick your bombs diagonally. Other new features include the ability to pump up bombs, knock 
foes unconscious, grab and toss unconscious foes, and toss or kick bombs diagonally. Bomberman 64 is 
a blast!

Carmageddon 64 (c) Jul 25, 2000 Software Creations Ltd. / Titus France SA 
 
Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is 
an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular 
due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated 
graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards). 
 
At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective 
is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and 
possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by 
driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits 
for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during 
the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups 
strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can 
win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight. 
 
Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

Castlevania - Legacy of Darkness (c) Dec 01, 1999 Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, Inc. / Konami 
Corporation 
 
4 games are waiting for you in this sequel to the first Castlevania Nintendo 64 adventure. Although 
at war with the same enemy in the same castle, you must fight as 4 different characters to save the 
day, with improved graphics and a new look to certain areas that appeared in the original. 
 
To begin with, set 8 years before the events that took place in Castlevania, the Count has kidnapped 
the young sister of Cornell, a powerful werewolf. As Cornell, you must battle your way through the 
castle and defeat Dracula to save your sister. 
 
Once completing the game as Cornell, you take up the role of Henry, a demon hating hero who must save 
captured children from the hands of Dracula within a set time limit. 
 
After that, you can then take on Dracula once again as the original heroes of Castlevania 64, 
Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez, and re-live the events of the previous game through new and 
improved surroundings.

Centre Court Tennis (c) Oct 09, 1998 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
Centre Court Tennis is a tennis game that does not take itself too seriously. After creating your 
Lego-like character, you are set to go! 
 
The basic game features a multiplayer mode (up to 4 players), a tournament mode and an exhibition 
mode. You also have four mini-games, "Tennis Court Bingo", "Burning Barrels", "Run and Gun" & 
Knock'em Down", where your goal is to hit certain objects in the tennis field. You can win special 
prices for getting enough points. 
 
Additionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd 
conditions - your tennis field might be rotating, made from ice or about to explode, to name a few. 
Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choosing from your 
opponent's dressing room. Lose and you lose an item that your opponent picked. Keep on losing and you 
have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of 
family-friendly strip tennis.

Davy the chameleon is minding his own business, when a rabbit catches his eye. Following the rabbit

tongue. Stuck in an unknown world, he must use his new strength to find his way out back to his home. 
 
Using the analog stick, you can control Davy's tongue to catch enemies and throw them back as 
bullets, grab onto to distant poles and ledges for a quick way through the land, or perform tricks 
like tongue-pole vault, in which he can reach even higher distances by using his tongue as a pole

For the second adventure, you can now choose from 4 different Chameleon's, Davy and friends Linda, 
Fred and Jack. 
And as well as using his tongue, Davy can also use a parasol to float across large gaps.

In Chopper Attack, you take a chopper and.. well.. attack! You get to choose between eight different 
attack choppers, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. 
 
After the briefing from your XO, you are set to destroy something - tanks, other helicopters, planes, 
radars, buildings etc. While the mission only requires you to do something specific, destroying 
everything gives you bonuses and money, which you can then use to buy more heavy-duty missiles 
between the missions. 
 
If you look at the screenshots, you might think that Chopper Attack is a helicopter simulation. It's 
not. Your elevation is fixed. There are no physics. You have boss fights with GIANT choppers. The 
game is pure 3D action, plain and simple.

Clay Fighter - Sculptor's Cut (c) 1998 Interplay Entertainment Corp. / Interplay Entertainment Corp. 
 
Let's Get Ready to Crumble! 
 
Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable 
clay (!) fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and the legendary Earthworm 
Jim himself! It is the sequel to Clay Fighter 63 1/3 and famous for only being released as a 
Blockbuster rental exclusive. 
 
Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The 
most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and a 2D-style fixed camera angle. 
You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either. 
 
Moves are a mix of standard punches & kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands nor legs 
to begin with) and a large number of unique special moves and combos for all. You can sometimes 
interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the 
other side. You can also end the fights with Mortal Kombat-style "Claytalities".

Command & Conquer (c) Jun 29, 1999 Looking Glass Studios, Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Command & Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game 
which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing 
them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation. 
 
The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense 
Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units 
and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry. 
 
In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are 
the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted 
into money - money which is needed to create additional units. 
 
The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.

Conker's Bad Fur Day (c) Mar 05, 2001 Rare, Ltd. / Rare, Ltd.

like other Rare platformers including Banjo-Kazooie, with a twist. 
 
In this case, Conker has had one hell of a night, and when he wakes up not only does he have a huge 
hangover, but something just doesn't feel right. So it's up to Conker and his many skills to clean 
things up. 
 
Conker goes through plenty of wild and wacky levels, most of which are based on classic movies 
including The Matrix, Jaws, Aliens, The Terminator and even Eyes Wide Shut. A multiplayer mode is 
also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay.

The sequel to Cruis'n World both in the arcades and on Nintendo 64, Cruis'n Exotica lets you race 
against the computer or up to three other opponents in a wide variety of cars and locales. Game 
mechanics follow "arcade" rules, which include "turbos" to accelerate to (and raise) maximum speed, 
and any deviation off of the track bumps you right back on it. 
 
Cars range from sportcars to more esoteric cars like trucks, minis, and police vehicles. Tracks model 
real life (Alaska, India, Korea, etc.) and eventually branch out into fantasy worlds (Atlantis, 
Amazon, Mars).

throughout the USA. Various pre-game options included are the choice of automatic or manual 
transmission, various controller configurations, as well as background music selection option. 
 
Players take control of the vehicle from a third-person perspective, and while avoiding various 
hazards along the way, must beat the clock as well as the CPU controlled rivals to gain first-place. 
 
With fourteen courses to ultimately choose from, Cruis'n USA takes players on a tour across some of 
the most famous and notorious roads and highways across the continent. Some of the locations include: 
Golden Gate Park, Redwood Forest, Beverly Hills and the Grand Canyon.

Cruis'n World (c) Jun, 1997 Midway / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Pack your bags and prepare for a first class trip around the world. Your ticket is courtesy of 
Midway, who has transformed its arcade mega-hit Cruis'n World into an all-new racer for the N64. 
 
Cruis'n USA thrilled racers with a scenic trip across the highways of America, but this time the 
action will take you all around the world. Each track is packed full of realistic scenery and 
authentic landmarks, so playing this game could save you a lot of dough on travel expenses. You can 
catch a glimpse of the Sphinx, the Statue of Liberty, and the Mayan ruins without leaving the 
security of your living room couch. 
 
If you're looking for a realistic racing simulation with real world physics, then this is definitely 
not the game for you. The graphics are realistic, but the actual game play is twisted to the extreme. 
Even though blazing across the Great Wall of China may be unbelievable, it certainly is fun. You can 
leap-frog over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV. Add to 
this a bonus race that takes place on the moon, and you have a good idea of Midway's over-the-top 
execution of the Cruis'n concept. 
 
Many of us will never get the chance to visit the Egyptian pyramids, let alone the opportunity to 
drive a screaming ambulance straight through them. Cruis'n World provides fun fantasy racing action, 
and the best thing about it is that you won't have to worry about your luggage getting left behind in 
Russia.

arcade elements such as 2 player battle mode, zany characters including Little Tiger, and game types 
that have you aiming to knock down the opposing character from his platform above a poll of lava, and 
you will soon notice how different Cyber really is.

The cosmos is controlled by two Prime Elements, known as "Core" and "Dark". Each is possessed by a 
tyrant who is in perpetual search of the third element, the Light, which would grant its owner 
tremendous power. Sonork Nezom, the carrier of Core Element, has organized a fighting tournament, 
with Core Element itself being the prize. He hopes that the carrier of the Light Element will be 
among the participants. He plans then to strike and gain possession of all the elements at once. But 
Lord Demon Demitron, the carrier of the Dark Element, has other plans... 
 
In this one-on-one fighting game, the player can take any of the eight playable participants through 
the tournament mode. Once the selected hero has defeated his opponents, he will have to face battles 
against Sonork and Demitron. A practice mode is also available. During the fights the player can use 
standard attacks common for all the characters - vertical and horizontal punches, kicks, running 
jumps, etc. Each character also possesses an arsenal of special techniques, which can be executed by 
pressing different buttons in rapid succession.

Dezaemon 3D is more of a game creator than an actual game. While it ships with two games, what really 
makes the cartridge special is the editor. It is far more than a level editor - you can use it to 
design your own 3D shooting game! In fact, both games were done with the very same editor. 
 
Designing 3D models, doing textures and composing a hit song are no small tasks mind you, so if you 
are more of the impatient type, you can skip the editor and head straight for the two sample games, 
Solid Gear and Usagi. Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. 
 
Solid Gear is a "serious" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting 
enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. 
 
Usagi is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, 
missiles.. and bunnies. A whole lot of bunnies.

Diddy Kong Racing (c) Oct 31, 1997 Rare, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island!  After the 
islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him 
reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return.  Along for the ride are the 
Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary 
Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse. 
 
Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a 
variety of cheery racers while using weapons.  However, the similarities end there.  DKR includes an 
adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of 
hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge".  In this mode, 
in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout 
the courses (some in alternate paths). 
 
The game also features a strategic method of using weapons.  Each colored balloon on the track 
matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it 
up (to a maximum of three times).  This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon 
available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version 
of it later. 
 
Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be 
unlocked in the single player game.  There are also four battle modes of play - two standard 
deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in 
your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest 
(with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).

Disney's Donald Duck - Goin' Quackers (c) Dec 13, 2000 Ubi Soft Entertainment Software / Ubi Soft 
Entertainment Software 
 
You play as Donald in this 3d platform action game.  Donald's girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a 
television station in Duckberg.  While doing a story on the secret temple of Merlock, a terrible 
magician, Daisy is kidnapped.  Now, it is up to Donald to get her back.  Along the way he will have 
help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose.  He will also have 
competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy. 
 
Game play alternates between side-scrolling running and jumping and 3d running and jumping. The side 
scrolling levels play a lot like the Super Mario Bros. games.  The 3d levels play a lot like the 
Crash Bandicoot series of games.  All in all, there are 20 levels, spread out through areas.

We could call it a platform game if it wasn't 3D, but it still looks like a platform game. Much alike 
to "Lion King" only seeable made of polygons. This little arcade game puts you in a role of Tarzan, a 
soon-to-be king of the jungle, leads you to a bunch of quest levels where you can collect coins, map 
pieces, 'TARZAN' letters and other stuff, as well as call you monkey friend from time to time that'll 
give you a brief explanation of things flyin' around. After each completed level, there will be a 
brief animations that they've probably taken from Disney's cartoon.

Donkey Kong 64 (c) Nov 22, 1999 Rareware / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Donkey Kong 64 is similar to Rareware's other Nintendo 64 platformer series, Banjo Kazooie, but 
starring Donkey Kong and his friends from the Donkey Kong Country games. Several new features have 
been added to the game, like being able to change between different characters with different weapons 
and abilities. 
 
As with many platformer games players will run around the various levels, jumping, swimming, and 
climbing where needed. Each level has multiple objectives, such as collecting DK's stolen golden 
bananas, collecting bananas color coded to each of the five characters, and miscellaneous other 
objects that need to be found to eventually complete 100% of the game. The player starts only being 
able to choose Donkey Kong, and must rescue the other four characters from the early levels before 
they can be used. By visiting Cranky Kong in each level more moves can be learned for each character, 
allowing them to complete challenges and reach sections in levels that were previously inaccessible.

Duke Nukem 64 (c) Nov 14, 1997 Eurocom Entertainment Software / GT Interactive Software Corp. 
 
Duke Nukem 3D makes its way to the N64 for the first time, with plenty of new additions: 
 
Weapons: New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just 
go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing 
from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray. 
 
Presentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved 
environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden 
away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now). 
 
However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced 
some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the 
nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off. 
 
A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 
2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.

The sequel to Fighters Destiny (the title now without the s in 'Fighters') has you again taking your

As with the first title, the aim is to hit a number of targets on the opposition's body to gain 
points, as well as knockouts, ring-outs, time expiry and so forth. In total there are over 30 moves 
to be used. The winner is the one with the most points at the end, which will not necessarily be the 
one with the most energy left.

Fighter's Destiny (c) Jan 27, 1998 Genki Co., Ltd.|Imagineer Co., Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
Take a collection of fist-fighters, wrestlers and martial arts experts, and combine them into one 
tournament. But instead of relying on simply depleting the health bar, you must win points depending 
on how you defeat an opponent (for example, ring-outs are 1 point, special moves 4 points and 
countering a special move is 2 points). 
 
Game modes include the standard VS. mode, simply defeat everyone you see. VS. Battle allows you to 
defeat the enemy, then acquire their moves for the next round. The Master Challenge has you spinning 
a wheel to determine who your fight. Spin up a Master, and you get a tough challenge in which you can 
win new moves. Spin a Joker, and you simply have a challenge, with nothing to gain, but everything to 
lose.

Fighting Force 64 (c) Apr 30, 1999 Core Design Ltd. / Crave Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Fighting Force is a fighting "beat-em-up" which takes place in an interactive city where you can pick 
up several objects (like trash cans and car tires) and throw them at your enemies which appear on 
scripted moments. 
 
Though the game advertised very interactive places, they all ended up in rectangular arenas because 
of an invisible wall which surrounded them. There was no way to walk around freely.

Flying Dragon (c) Jul 31, 1998 Culture Brain Inc. / Natsume, Inc. 
 
Flying Dragon is a side-view battle game reminiscent of 16-bit titles. It features eight characters 
to choose from with two main modes of play, "SD" (super deformed) and "Virtual" (ala 'Virtua Fighter' 
style). 
 
SD mode is sort of RPG'ish with treasures you gain from winning battles and becoming a stronger 
fighter. it has the usual circuit, tournament and practice modes plus a 'treasure box' where you 
check your existing items, buy new items or trade items you already have for something else. 
 
Virtual mode is the more familiar format of a battle game with game modes such as circuit, tournament 
and practice. It also has 2D and 3D "rules" for how the game is played. 2D is 16-bit arcade style and 
3D is more realistic.

Forsaken 64 (c) May 27, 1998 Iguana Entertainment, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Earth has been rendered largely uninhabitable by an explosion caused by a bungled experiment. Few 
would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of 
its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a 
few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last. 
 
Forsaken is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, 
as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level 
has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are 
collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft 
out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured 
in the game) and past encounters. 
 
On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 
player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.

Car setup is highly detailed, reflecting real Formula One and the game's simulation basis. You will 
have to race in the wet, which means further setup modification to cope with the reduced grip. You 
can also edit the level of car damage, the pit-car radio, and whether the CPU cars can collide. There 
are also Battle and Time Trial modes, with your best laptimes recorded.

F-Zero X (c) Oct 26, 1998 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Famed SNES racer F-Zero got this N64 update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a 
futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious 
opponents. 
 
Where the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles 
all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable 
power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars 
and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks 
are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial 
mode, against a 'ghost car' recording of your best previous lap, a lá Mario Kart 64. 
 
Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, 
loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature 
amongst almost all other racing games is the "X" tournament, where courses are totally randomly 
generated each time you start. 
 
One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 
players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play. 
 
This game has a  rock soundtrack, which I believe is the first game soundtrack ever to feature the 
bestial grunting found only in death metal music.

characters make on the board, you get to to pit your cards against the other character's cards with 
the outcome determined by their stats. Your characters have a finite health, and depending on the 
outcome of the battles you may get to add monster cards to your collection, lose positions in the 
board, or simply die. 
 
Additionally you can link up to Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke Douchuu Tobidase Nabe-Bugyou! for the Game

Gauntlet Legends (c) Aug 31, 1999 Midway Games West, Inc. / Midway Games, Inc. 
 
As many as four (Expansion Pak required) can band together in an epic quest through seven magical 
worlds -- three of which are brand-new to the home version -- to defeat the vile Skorne. 
 
The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You 
can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level 
in the first world. 
 
Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade 
version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players 
to team their evolving characters. 
 
Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is 
busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so 
don't even think of cribbing from the coin-op version. 
 
Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The 
N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen. 
 
The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the 
stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a 
far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a 
world.

Getter Love!! (c) Dec 04, 1998 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. 
 
Getter Love!! is a dating sim where a high school student and his friends are having a competition to 
see who will get a girlfriend first. Because of that and unlike other dating sim games you will have 
to face up to three human or CPU players to win the heart of the girl (or girls) you set your eyes 
on. 
 
Game Start, Battle, Ranking and Memories are what the menu options include. 
 
1. Game Start is the option from where you can access all the major  single and multiplayer modes. 
 
1. "N" - the main story mode of the game where you play against 3 CPU players. 
 
2. "VS" - same as the previous mode but opponents can be either human or CPU players. 
 
3. "VS" - players will only be able to go for a certain girl that is decided at the beginning of 
   each game 
 
4. "VS" - players can go for any girl but there is a set time limit 
 
Battle is where you can practice mini-games found in the main story and compete against other 
players. 
 
5. Ranking allows you to see statistics like how many times you have beaten the game with each 
   girl, the fastest time you took to beat the game, etc. 
 
6. Memories is the place where you can view all the special events and endings you have seen 
   during the game. 
Gameplay: After selecting a name and a character, from the 8 available, you'll be given a 
"relationship head-start" for a random girl. The game will then take you to a screen where each of 
the 4 players can select an action before a turn starts. An action can be viewing the dates you have, 
finding out each girl's interests or selecting a destination and initiating the turn. By doing that 
you will be transported to a 3D depiction of the map where you will view random events for all 4 
players. Events are usually triggered when you find a girl at the location that you visited the given 
time and from there you can talk with that girl and if your relationship experience with that girl is 
high you can give her gifts and ask her for dates. When all players' events are over the turn ends (1 
day passes) and the same procedure is repeated until the girl's love meter is high enough for you to 
express your feelings for her.

The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming's novels returns in this first-person 
shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan 
(a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James 
Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead. 
 
Ten years later, a mysterious organization named "Janus" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called 
"GoldenEye", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all 
evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an 
end to Janus' ambitions. 
 
In this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of 
weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you 
to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your 
presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you'll have 
to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important 
evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of 
options, and three difficulty levels.

grandfather, who has died recently.  In the village many people help you out on your long journey.  
During this time you can attend festivals, race in horse races, farm, tend to your livestock, add to 
your house, get married, or maybe even have a child.  There are 5 beautiful women to be chosen from, 
each having their own jobs and personalities.  At the end the player's parents come by and rate them 
after 2 and a half years of performance.  The option then exists either to keep going or stop there.  
The real question is if you're up for the challenge.

Hercules - The Legendary Journeys (c) Nov 17, 2000 Player 1 / Titus France SA 
 
Ares, Hercules' brother, forms a plan to dethrone Zeus with the help of Hera. With Zeus ill, a 
struggle for power corrupts the immortal realm. The Gods, unaware of the true nature of the 
disturbance, flee to the mortal realm in a search to find the reason for the turmoil. 
 
Hercules, a man whose strength is like nothing ever seen, is the only one who can save the world, 
both mortal and immortal, and his father from certain doom. 
 
Take control of the legendary hero as you travel around the land in search of a cure, and to stop 
Ares from completing his plan. Based on the TV series of the same name, you can also take control of

Hexen (c) May 31, 1997 Beam Software Pty., Ltd. / GT Interactive Software Corp. 
 
Hexen is the sequel to Heretic.  While the Heretic was destroying D'Sparil, the other two Serpent 
Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have 
managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains 
in their world. 
 
Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations 
like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes 
this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The 
characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage.  Each one has four unique weapons and different 
levels of speed and armor. 
 
The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system 
which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. 
In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels 
are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the 
"spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels. 
 
Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects 
such as trees and vases.

Hey You, Pikachu! (c) Nov 05, 2000 Ambrella / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Hey You, Pikachu! is a pokémon adventure game. The game allows you to speak directly to Pikachu via 
the Voice Recognition Unit (VRU) included with the game, in order to tell Pikachu what to do and help 
direct the adventures the two of you embark on. 
 
The game features 20 different minigames which you and Pikachu play together. Some involve you 
catching water pokémon, while another might send you search for ingredients for stew. When the 
minigame is over, you go back home and sleep, waking up the next day to play another game. As the 
game progresses more of the features and minigames are unlocked, and Pikachu's friendship meter will 
grow. 
 
Pikachu will understand around 200 different words or simple phrases like "come here", "stop that", 
and "eat it". Voice communication is the primary method of interacting with the game, though the 
analog stick is used for navigation.

Jet Force Gemini (c) Oct 12, 1999 Rare, Ltd. / Rare, Ltd. 
 
Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police.  Their mission? 
 Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army 
of Drones.  They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and 
rescuing his subjects, the Tribals. 
 
Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into 
dribbly mucousy bits.  The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the 
Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up 
for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, 
sending explosive doom in the direction of your target.  There's also the Fish Food, which is used 
to...er, feed fish.  Really. 
 
Even though they're called Drones, these bugs aren't stupid.  When encountered, they'll rush you, 
hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements when you confront them.  They also 
take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be rescuing.  But the Drones 
are nothing compared to the game's insanely difficult bosses, which includes a pair of gigantic 
praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few. 
 
Each of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, 
Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces.  
These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach.  The team 
also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a 
floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team. 
 
The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an 
average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery 
with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top 
down racing games.

Kirby 64 - The Crystal Shards (c) Jun 26, 2000 HAL Laboratory, Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Kirby's adventure for the Nintendo 64 is a polygonal side-scroller similar to Klonoa - however, 
unlike Klonoa, the game only follows one set path instead of multiple branching paths.  In this game, 
Kirby can still copy the abilities of his foes - but in addition to this, he can combine these 
abilities with others to make unique combinations.  (For one example, combining electricity and ice 
will turn Kirby into a fridge that spits out food.) 
 
The story begins with Dark Matter assaulting a faraway land for their special crystal.  A young fairy 
called Ribbon takes the crystal and escapes to save it.  She lands in Dream Land, but pieces of the 
crystal have shattered and landed all across the world.  Kirby volunteers to help and together they 
go to find all the missing pieces. 
 
Kirby will encounter his friends, who have been controlled by Dark Matter.  He'll have to battle them 
to rescue them.  From there, they travel together to other different worlds, including Rock Star, 
Water Star, and Ripple Star, Ribbon's home world, where Dark Matter is lurking.  To properly finish 
the game, players must find all the hidden crystal shards tucked away in the various levels.  Only 
then will Kirby and his friends truly save Ripple Star.

Legend of Zelda, The - Majora's Mask (c) Oct 26, 2000 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
After ending the terror of evil in Hyrule, Link sets out to find another quest to complete, but on 
his way he stumbles into the wait of another evil force. Link awakens in a dazed and confused state, 
missing his Ocarina and his horse, and seems to be cursed. To make matters worse, Termina, the world 
that he has ended up in, is about to be destroyed by the Moon in less than three days, taking the 
rest of the world with it, including Hyrule. It is up to Link to save the day again. 
 
Time travel and mask hunting take a bigger chunk out of the quest compared to the last Zelda. 
Although there are only three days to complete the game, the player is able to travel back in time 
after finding the  Ocarina. Any items that were found and any quests that were  completed are either 
saved or lost, depending on importance. Certain Masks turn Link into powerful characters, each with 
their own advantages (like the Zora Link, who can swim underwater for very long periods of time). 
 
There are also plenty of sub-quests to complete and items to find, however the clock is always 
ticking away until the end of the world...

Legend of Zelda, The - Ocarina of Time (c) Nov 23, 1998 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
For the first time, The Legend of Zelda makes its way to the N64, in fine fashion. Our hero Link is 
once again called for to save the Kingdom of Hyrule, and this time he has a time travel device called 
the Ocarina to help him in his quest. 
 
Ganon is once again up to his old tricks, and Princess Zelda, as well as the Great Deku Tree ask for 
Links help. To guide him, a young fairy called Navi shows him the tricks of the trade. You begin the 
adventure with the task of collecting your sword and shield, and then saving the Deku Tree from the 
evil that has attacked. From there, you travel to Hyrule, and the many worlds that stem from Hyrule 
Field. 
 
There are many, many new things in this Zelda compared to past versions, including the use of time 
travel and the two different Links on each side (young Link, who you start the adventure with, and 
teen Link, who you must turn into to complete certain areas of the game). Weapons are also a key 
feature, with bombs, swords and other nifty gadgets available to help you in your quest.

The Emperor Monk of Pandora has begun raiding the Out-Sector Colonies, stealing vital gold supplies 
from the free systems. The Federated Hegemonies have no choice but to ask the Lode Runners to stop 
the raids and put an end to the Emperor's rule. 
 
Unable to use the full fleet on the Emperor's defenses, which would cause mass casualties, they 
decide that a lone Lod Runner should enter the enemy base to recover any gold found and destroy the 
Emperor. 
 
From an isometric style perspective, you must guide Lode Runner through each of the levels, dodging 
defensive blocks and enemies by either placing bombs and blowing holes in the ground to finding 
another way around. By finding all of the gold on the level, you can then progress to the next level.

Mace - The Dark Age (c) Oct, 1997 Atari Games Corporation / Midway Home Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Mace: The Dark age is a 3D fighting game set in a dark fantasy setting. Players can choose between 18 
characters from all over the world equipped with swords, daggers, maces, katanas and other weapons. 
Basic moves include: a quick and a strong attack with weapons, kicks, sidesteps, and throws. 
Additional attacks can be performed by pressing the standard attack buttons in different positions or 
combined with directional buttons. Counter attacks are also possible, but require more complicated 
button combinations and good timing. Standard moves can be linked to combos and each character has a 
number of individual special moves that require specific button combinations to be used. 
 
Battle arenas feature multiple levels and usually contain hazards like acid pools or swinging axes 
that deal damage when touched. Some arenas also contain interactive objects like plant pots or 
torches that can be thrown at opponents. 
 
The game is fairly bloody (the gore can be turned off in the options menu) and all characters have 
their own finishing moves 
(called executions) - particularly brutal ways of killing an opponent.

Mario Golf (c) Jul 26, 1999 Camelot Software Planning / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Since Mario rescued Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, he's been thoroughly enjoying his free time. 
Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to 
the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become 
members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. 
 
Mario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game 
celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of 
strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special "Time Attack Mode," where players 
must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. 
 
Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a 
total of 108 holes. An optional "Club Handicap Mode" ensures that you stay close to the competition, 
so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the 
physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind 
direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.

Mario Kart 64 (c) Feb 12, 1997 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively 
tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute 
gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on 
Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy 
surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, 
though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of 
Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted 
Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. 
 
The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even 
more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has 
distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly 
steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like 
Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning 
Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.

Mario Party (c) Feb 08, 1999 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
You know Mario can jump. You know he can kick Bowser's tail from here to the moon, but we bet you 
didn't realize that Mario is the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Nintendo is throwing 
the most insane bash to ever hit the N64, and you're invited. For the first time, you'll catch a 
glimpse of how Mario celebrates all of the victories he's had over the years. 
 
Mario Party is unlike any other game for the N64, and it just might be the best party game to ever 
hit the system. Mario Party is designed for 1 to 4 players, but it's not really a party unless you're 
playing with your pals. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that 
players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. The fun starts when players land on 
different squares, because each space holds one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick 
competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. 
 
The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately 
available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and 
others are even three against one. The games are simple, but remarkably fun to play. One challenge is 
loosely based on "Simon Says," another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one crazy game makes 
one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. 
You'll find skill games, racing games, puzzle games --basically any type of challenge you could 
imagine. 
 
A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges 
scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all 
invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board. 
 
Mario Party is fun for only one player, but to get the most out of this party-in-a-pak, you should 
play with three other friends. It's definitely the kind of game that will keep you up till the wee 
hours of the morning, so you might want to start catching up on your sleep right away.

Mario Party 2 (c) Jan 09, 2000 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Mario and a range of well known Nintendo characters, including Yoshi, Bowser, Luigi, and Wario return 
for some more party action. 
 
The second edition includes 5 new boards, each with a specific theme, such as Space Land, Western 
Land, Horror Land, and Mystery Land. Each board includes unique attributes in relation to the theme, 
but the main goal is the same: complete the board game over a certain amount of moves and be the 
player to have the most coins and/or stars at the end. 
 
The single player story mode allows one person and 3 CPU controlled players to play each board. Once 
you play a specific mini-game (64 in all), they become available to purchase using the coins you 
collected in your games to play anytime. Multiplayer allows 2 to 4 people to play the game.

Mario Party 3 (c) May 06, 2001 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
The series continues with a set of 70 new mini-games.  Play in the new single-player Story mode, or 
bring in some friends for Party mode.  Four player games and a new two player mode are also available 
for play. 
 
In Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and 
coins.  At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken 
chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions. 
 
Duel mode allows play between just two people.  You still race around the board, but mini-games are 
only played when you land on a specific square.  Another play change is the addition of another 
character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game. 
 
Story mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the 
computer.

Mega Man 64 (c) Jan 16, 2001 Capcom Co., Ltd. / Capcom Entertainment, Inc. 
 
In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And 
where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the 
hunt... 
 
Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his 
young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange 
baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby 
boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan. 
 
While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island 
named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge 
treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel 
decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from 
a pirate family named the Bonnes... 
 
Mega Man Legends is the first of the Mega Man series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is 
paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and 
follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral 
Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon 
energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching 
through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought 
back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. 
Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy 
and circle around them to avoid their attacks.

The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar!  All that was left of him 
was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van.  Mickey rounds up all of his friends 
(and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so 
that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States.  The 
Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor's top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of 
the tracks.  Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final 
showdown. 
 
Mickey's Speedway USA is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine.  Players 
compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end 
of all four races wins the gold trophy.  There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats 
shared between them.  Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are 
both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights. 
 
The game has an assortment of pickups - there's the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo

The course variety is pretty varied.  There are three separate tracks with some minor route 
variations in each.  Each course has  2-4 alternate segments that are turned on and off similar to 
Ridge Racer. 
 
The graphics have some variety as well.  The courses are: Sea Side (Easy), Mountain (Normal), and

The people of Oedo Town are in a panic!  A gigantic UFO shaped like a peach has arrived, and the 
Peach Mountain Shoguns have turned Oedo Castle into one big stage for themselves to perform on!  
Everyone's relying on Goemon to save the day, but he hasn't even noticed what's happening!  Can our 
hero stop the Shoguns before they do any more damage? 
 
Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an action-based RPG similar in style to The Legend of Zelda: The 
Ocarina of Time.  It is also the first localized Goemon game since The Legend of the Mystical Ninja 
for the SNES.  Players control Goemon and his friends as they make their way through Ancient Japan to 
stop the Peach Mountain Shoguns.  You can talk to characters, whack enemies with your pipe (or hurl 
coins at them), visit a deranged fortune teller who shrieks out "PLASMA!" at random intervals for no 
reason, and more. 
 
Each member of the Goemon team can also learn a special ability to access new areas as players 
progress through the game.  Goemon earns the "Sudden Impact" power, which lets him move blocks he 
normally couldn't, Ebisumaru can shrink to small sizes so he can pass through tiny cracks, Sasuke 
earns an extra high jump, and Yae gets the ability to transform into a Mermaid so that she can swim 
underwater. 
 
As usual, the gigantic roller-skating robot, Impact, makes an appearance.  Players get to use him to 
trample down buildings and duke it out in first-person mode against gigantic mecha boss characters in 
a Punch-Out!! style game.

opponent AI has been tweaked to make victory more dependent on executing the right moves at the right

well as create and build an own team. This time, it is also possible to use any picture to serve as a

major battles from the entire Evangelion saga and features original footage from the anime. 
 
In Story Mode you take control of bio-mechanical mechas called Evas to fight against monstrous beings 
called Angels. To see every mission through, combo attacks (punches and kicks), blocking and 
grappling techniques are available at your disposal. Depending on the damage the Eva you control 
takes and if certain parameters are met during that time you will be given a time limit in which you 
must end the battle with the Angel. 
 
The Simulation Mode: almost plays like a shooter. It’s a 1st-person perspective mode where you must 
eliminate as many Angels as possible within the time limit. When the time limit ends you get a rank 
depending on how many enemies you destroyed and how many bullets you used.

No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties 
are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up 
the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined 
happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it 
is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for 
someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.

NHL 99 (c) Oct 01, 1998 Electronic Arts Canada / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete 
ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the 
International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose 
IIHF rules and rink size. 
 
Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player 
faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in 
better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a 
return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to 
the game. 
 
As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer 
players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to 
pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to 
shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of 
moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too 
close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the 
player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new 
Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an 
overly strong opponent. 
 
The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively 
or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with 
their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft. 
 
Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and 
colour commentary.

NHL Breakaway 98 (c) Feb 26, 1998 Sculptured Software, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
This ice hockey game has a playbook-based AI system based on the teams' actual playbooks allowing for 
specific teams to play their actual styles, with variable player size, from big defensemen to small 
speedy wingers. There is a total team management system to make trades, improve coaching, create 
draft picks and send players through training camps, or even send injured athletes for therapy. 
 
The inclusion of all the marquee players such as Lemieux, Gretzky, Messier, Sakic, Hull, and others 
is mostly mandatory in sports games. Also, the hints about how to play each team from NHL player 
Keith Tkachuk are a useful resource.

Nightmare Creatures (c) 1997 Kalisto Entertainment SA / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion 
onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates 
its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of 
murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend 
Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and 
gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of 
Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley. 
 
Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different 
fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the 
hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, 
or just kill them using basic weapons.

Nushi Tsuri 64 (c) Nov 27, 1998 DDL Co., Ltd. / Pack-In-Soft 
 
Nushi Tsuri 64 is a fishing-themed role-playing game. It was the first installment of the series for 
the N64 console and received a Japanese-only release. 
 
There are 6 characters from which you can choose from before you start the game. Just like most RPGs 
you can freely roam the town, visit other towns as well, talk to NPCs and buy stuff which are mostly 
fishing-related. To fish you need to find a suitable spot and after catching a fish you can keep it 
to a water tank and feed it. 
 
While walking random encounters can occur at any time in which you are transferred at a different 
screen and have the choice of either throwing stuff like rocks at the enemy to chase them away or run 
across a path-like bar to reach to safety and end the battle. If you choose to do the latter you are 
vulnerable as the enemy is able to attack you and have your health depleted.

Off Road Challenge is an off-road truck racing game for the Nintendo 64.  Like Cruis'n USA, it was 
also an arcade game ported over to the N64.  Gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Super 
Off Road: The Baja.  The player races against other off-road vehicles across various landscapes, 
while collecting nitros and gold along the way.  Gold picked up on the course or earned from racing 
can be used to upgrade the vehicle.  Once the player has completed the circuit, they move up to the 
next difficulty level and go through it again, keeping the upgraded truck.

Ogre Battle 64 - Person of Lordly Caliber (c) Oct 05, 2000 Quest / Atlus U.S.A., Inc. 
 
You play Magnus Gallant, who leads the revolution for the kingdom of Palatinus. The kingdoms lord, 
Holy Lodis Empire, is rumored to be planning the domination of the entire continent of Zeteginia. 
This creates concern among the people, and it is up to Magnus to rid the Lord from the kingdom, to 
free the people from slavoury forever. 
 
A semi-sequel to the original Ogre Battle which came out on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System 
(SNES), and the third in the series, you don't actually control where the characters go, but you do 
control their actions and fighting techniques (much like Age of Empires and similar war-based 
titles). The main characters, Magnus, leads many troops into each battle, and you must control how 
each group attacks or defends, and if you wish to use straight forward attacks or magic. 
 
Depending on what you achieve, there are branching levels (much like Starfox 64), each with their own 
difficulty levels. The more battles you face and complete, the experience of each warrior in your 
team increases, so when you reach the latter levels, your team will last much longer against stronger 
opponants.

subscribers that you need to sign-up before you can move onto the next, and more challenging street 
(aka, the next level). Each street also includes objects that will get in your way (such as dogs, 
fire hydrants, etc.) as well as bonus objectives (collecting three coins by knocking down people and

Paper Mario (c) Feb 06, 2002 Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Up in Star Haven, there exists a Star Wand that allows the stars to grant wishes to those who are 
pure of heart. The Star Wand is looked over by the Seven Star Spirits, who protect it in its 
sanctuary. However, Bowser attacks Star Haven, steals the Star Wand, and locks up the Star Spirits so 
that they cannot challenge his power. With his new powers, Bowser defeats Mario and lifts Princess 
Peach's castle into the air, taking her and all her guests as prisoners. Now, the only way to 
challenge Bowser's unbridled power is to rescue all seven Star Spirits, which have been imprisoned 
all over the land. 
 
Paper Mario is the follow-up to Super Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars for Super Nintendo. 
Basically, this is an RPG set in the Mario universe.  Mario has the ability to gain experience and 
grow levels by defeating enemies and bosses. Mario also has the ability to recruit teammates to help 
him out in battle. As well, Mario can collect badges that will help his combat abilities, star pieces 
that he can trade for badges, and more items that he can use throughout the game. The Star Spirits 
will also aid him in his quest. 
 
Like Super Mario RPG before it, Paper Mario's graphics are very unique to any other game. All the 
characters are 2D within a fully 3D world. This gives the feeling that each character is made out of 
"paper".

Penny Racers (c) 1999 Locomotive / THQ Inc. 
 
Penny Racers is a racing game with cartoonish, made-of-paper-like cars. There are thirteen cars which 
you can choose from and nine tracks in total – all available right from the start. It features two 
playable modes, Race Series and Time Trial, and a mode that allows you to create your own track. The 
game also supports up to four human players. 
 
In Race Series you can select one of the thirteen cars and race in any of the nine tracks with five 
more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty) races at first but can unlock 
more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each race you are given the 
option to customize your car’s parts – parts like the car’s body, engine, tires, etc. – but only if 
you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the other cars at the 
end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, 
each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. 
For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If 
with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not 
allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players. 
 
Time Trial is the basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost 
to race against. 
 
VS Race mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that 
are different from the ones of the other modes and these tracks have more obstacles. 
 
New Track lets you create your own custom made track. You can select the road type (on road/off road) 
and track type (circuit/stage). After the basic layout is selected you are taken on the “map” where 
you can choose from the available layers to make the track. You can also adjust the road’s height.

Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous

devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The 
speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new 
technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. 
Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the 
company headquarters... 
 
Perfect Dark is a first person game similar to Rare's earlier Goldeneye: 007 though with more of an 
emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms.  In addition she carries quite 
a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop. 
 
The Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. 
It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.

PGA European Tour (c) Jun 15, 2000 Infogrames Studios Ltd. / Infogrames, Inc. 
 
European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It 
features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of 
the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the 
intervening years of advances in programming skill. 
 
The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define 
intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured 
effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect. 
 
As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole 
round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to 
win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

Welcome to Pokémon Puzzle League! Being selected to participate in the Official Puzzle League 
Tournament is one of the greatest honors a Pokémon Trainer can earn. In this brand new type of 
Pokémon battle, you'll have to use your strongest Pokémon to compete against the very best Trainers 
in Puzzle League Village. 
 
To succeed in Pokémon Puzzle League, your fingers have to be fast and your brain has to work even 
faster. True Pokémon Puzzle Masters will discover many ways to play the game, but the basic idea is 
to destroy puzzle pieces by matching up three or more blocks of the same color. 
 
The more puzzle pieces you eliminate at the same time, the more points you'll score. If you're 
battling another Trainer, you can send powerful attacks to their puzzle board by completing big 
Combos and Skill Chains. If you can't clear your stack of puzzle pieces before they reach the top of 
the screen, you're doomed. 
 
You'll discover many challenges as you travel through Puzzle League Village, from the exciting 3D 
Puzzle Mode to the brain-bruising exercises at Pokémon Puzzle University. The best way to experience 
Pokémon Puzzle League is to bring a friend along on your adventure. Heated two-player Pokémon battles 
are so intense and action-packed that you just might forget to breathe!

Pokemon Snap (c) Jun 30, 1999 HAL Laboratory, Inc.|Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
As Todd Snap, an aspiring Pokémon photographer, you must travel through different environment types 
in order to photograph as many Pokémon as you can find. With the help of Professor Oak, you will 
discover new places to photograph Pokémon, ranging from those such as a volcano which houses Fire 
Pokémon to a jungle housing Grass Pokémon. The game features 63 of the original 151 Pokémon, 
including favorites such as Pikachu and Charizard. 
 
Throughout your journey as a Pokémon photographer you will obtain new items from Professor Oak to 
help snap a photo of those Pokémon whose attention you just can't seem to attract. At first you are 
equipped with only an apple, but by taking great photos of various species you will get access to 
items such as a Pester Ball or a Poké Flute. Gameplay is similar to that of a rail-shooter, in which 
you move across a linear route and are only able to look around to take pictures. At the end of each 
route you receive a score from Oak depending on things such as the position of the Pokémon in the 
frame shot, the size of the Pokémon in the picture, or how many of that Pokémon are together in the 
shot. Up to 60 photos can be taken during each course and you choose the one to submit to Oak. All 
the photos you take can later be accessed in your own Pokémon album. The game features six different 
courses, but a seventh one can be unlocked by taking a picture of a mysterious Pokémon sign in each 
of the other courses. The seventh course known as Rainbow Cloud offers the only opportunity to snap a 
photo of  the rare and elusive psychic Pokémon, Mew.

that you have from the range of Pokemon Game Boy Games (including the original Pokemon Red and Blue,

Premier Manager 64 (c) 1999 Dinamic Multimedia, S.A. / Gremlin Interactive Ltd. 
 
Unlike the data update that is PM98, Ninety Nine (the actual title of the game) uses Dinamics' PC 
Fútbol 6 engine to go along the obligatory 1998-99 squad updates. Among the new features, it is now 
possible to make more than one player bid at the same time, more frequent and detailed staff 
messages, player history to track down previous seasons, a full 3D match engine and a 2D radar view 
(replacing the old text mode) and finally merchandising and catering, and individual adboard 
management. The detailed database is still there, and so are the Manager and Pro-Manager modes. Only 
the English leagues are playable still and Kevin Keegan, Fulham and then soon-to-be England manager, 
endorsed the title. 
 
The manager modes and options remain the same: Manager allows the player to start in any team, 
Pro-Manager requires building a career from the Conference, promoting the club from the lower 
divisions or getting promoted himself to better ranked teams. The difficulty level can be further 
tweaked by changing areas where the staff takes control, and you can determince if players age and 
retire with time. 
 
Again, up to 20 players can play in Manager mode and 8 in Pro-Manager.

Puyo Puyo Sun 64 (c) 1997 Compile / Compile 
 
Another entry in the Puyo Puyo series of arcade puzzle games. The evil Dark Prince has caused the sun 
to augment its size and power to dangerous levels, and thus the Puyo Puyo world is on the verge of 
being scorched unless you prevent it. 
 
The game features 3 distinct story campaigns, each pitting you against a different set of enemies 
which you must battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In each stage you face off against an opponent in 
two different play areas, one for you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like "puyos" start 
falling in your play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear 
the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send 
several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing 
his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger. 
 
New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 
2P vs gameplay, challenge modes and galleries and other bonus features.

Quake 64 (c) Mar 24, 1998 Midway Games, Inc. / Midway Games, Inc. 
 
An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using 
teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his 
base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a 
teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless 
hordes of monsters, and exact revenge. 
 
id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological 
innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are 
polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for 
more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: 
grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example. 
 
In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four 
distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game 
world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or 
shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a 
few hidden levels. 
 
Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic 
imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each 
episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), 
later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, 
dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from 
Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors. 
 
The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and 
energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, 
ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's 
weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are 
shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical 
energy. 
 
Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The 
single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch 
mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast 
reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as 
arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

A sequel in name only, this follow up to id’s 1996 Quake, is a first-person shooter revolving around 
the Earth-Strogg war.  The Strogg alien race threatens the Earth, but Earth has launched a 
counter-offensive, Operation Alien Overlord.  Overlord takes the battle to the Strogg homeworld with 
the ultimate objective of securing their capitol city and killing their ruler. 
 
As a FPS, Quake II contains a variety of weapons including the fall back Blaster, the Railgun, and 
the secret BFG10K.  Health, armor, and ammunition pick-ups can be found during levels, as can the 
classic Quake’s Quad Damage power-up.  Game play involves mowing down alien opponents as the player 
progresses through levels, completing in-game objectives.  Quake II also comes with multiplayer 
support for Deathmatches.

Rakuga Kids (c) 1998 Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, Inc. / Konami Co., Ltd. 
 
It was school holidays, and the Twinkle gang of schoolkids sailed to an island where they found a 
cave with crayons hidden inside.  They split them among the group, but before they had finished, a 
bully came and stole the pack along with the last two crayons!  He drew a mischievous-looking 
character, who came to life and said "Let's cause trouble!"  Twinkle Town was terrified of the bully 
and his crayon character, so the Twinkle gang decided to draw their own superheroes to stop the 
bully! 
 
Rakugakids is a 2D fighting game, similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom.  You select from a variety of 
hand-drawn cartoon characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks.  As you'd 
expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves.  There 
is also a 'crayon meter' that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, 
you can pull off a devastating special move. 
 
The kids' characters are a lively bunch, full of an assortment of crazy moves.  There's Robot C.H.O., 
who is a robot that turns into different metal objects on the fly, such as a car, garbage can, 
rocket, and more.  There's BearTank, which is a green teddy bear with gun turrets on it.  
Captain.Cat.Kit is a DJ cat with slick basketball moves who also attacks with a variety of musical 
instruments. 
 
An interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using "Training Mode".  In 
this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you 
like.  It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in 'Battle Mode'.   
This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character.  If you've trained 
enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.

same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new 
characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus 
rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to

Rampage - World Tour (c) Mar 30, 1998 Game Refuge Inc. / Midway Games, Inc. 
 
Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage.  Rampage World Tour starts off at 
Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an 
accident involving toxic waste.  George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or 
dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they previously worked at 
and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe. 
 
The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, 
knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the 
world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive 
size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various 
militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play 
simultaneously. 
 
The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor.  Gameplay includes 
players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once 
all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed 
to the next stage.  Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or 
restore health.

Robotron 64 (c) Jan 06, 1998 Player 1 / Crave Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The retro shooter returns with the same addictive gameplay of the original arcade game, but now with 
the added power of the Nintendo 64. 
 
The aim of the game is simple. Shoot all the enemies on each grid while saving the humans from 
certain death. Power-ups and items can be picked up to increase your shooting and speed ability, and 
the further you go in the game, the more enemies attack and the more difficult it gets to save the 
humans. 
 
Options include the ability to plug in a second N64 controller for added control of the character on 
the game screen (i.e. two analog sticks). The brand new 3D engine, while sporting similar styled 
graphics that hark back to the 80's classic, also boasts fuller textures and greater mobility for the 
character.

Rocket - Robot on Wheels (c) Nov 17, 1999 Sucker Punch Productions LLC / Ubi Soft Entertainment 
Software 
 
Whoopy World was finished.  The high-tech theme-park would be opening tomorrow.  How much Rocket, the 
maintenance robot, wanted to go and see it he could not even tell, but the professor barely noticed.  
Then it happened.  Jojo the raccoon, sick of playing second banana to the insipid Whoopy the walrus, 
stole all of the tokens, tickets, and Whoopy.  There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go 
and stop Jojo alone. 
 
Rocket: Robot on Wheels is a 3D platformer like no other.  It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in 
unscripted, realtime physics.  As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a 
dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again.  The 
vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to 
paint the town red, or any other color you choose.  In standard platformer fashion, tickets are 
hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at 
their own game.  The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually 
tumbling and falling like they would in real life.

Rugrats in Paris - The Movie (c) Nov, 2000 Avalanche Software LLC / THQ Inc. 
 
Rugrats in Paris: The Movie is based on the 2000 Movie of the same name, which in turn is based on 
the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series. 
 
Unlike the PC and Game Boy Color spin-offs from the movie, the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation games are 
3D platform games. 
 
Tommy Pickle's father has been sent to Europe for maintenance work at Euroreptarland. The Rugrats 
join him on his travel to Europe. There are 16 levels and hidden bonus level to play through. 
 
The game consists of various mini-games that have to be completed in order to earn enough tickets to 
beat the game. Most tickets, however, can just be collected by running around the park and picking 
them up. Tickets can be used to buy prizes. There are ten mini games including whack-a-ninja, bumper 
cars and mini-golf.

Rugrats - Scavenger Hunt (c) Jun 29, 1999 Realtime Associates Seattle Division / THQ Inc. 
 
Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt is a party game based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television 
series Rugrats. The game features three distinct board games that are represented in 3D similar to 
Mario Party. On each board the objective is to find a missing item. 
 
In Angelica's Temple of Gloom you have to beat Angelica in reaching various pieces of an Aztec 
statue. The Pirate Treasure hunt requires the Rugrats to travel underwater to find buried treasure. 
The Reptar Rally lets them collect candy on Candy Island. 
 
The game can be played with up to four players (or NPC players). each turn you can move as many paces 
as you got on the spinner (a replacement for dice). Some tiles have special actions attached to them 
that let you move further or gain or lose cookies. Each Rugrat also has limited energy, when they 
move a lot they get tired and have to take a nap to regain energy. You can collect Toy Cards to open 
doors or use against friends to gain an edge.

For the N64 version of the arcade hit, Midway added all-new courses and shortcuts. All six courses 
can be run in reverse, mirrored, or mirrored and reversed. There's even two hidden stunt courses! 
Graphically, the game sacrifices detail in favor of blindingly fast screen redraws. 
 
The gameplay is very arcade-like: You fly through the air with the greatest of ease, and when you hit 
a wall your car bursts into flames.  You can customize your car with different colors, racing 
stripes, tire rims and much more.

A racing game where you control one of five cutesy snowboarders competing against each other. Being a 
snowboarding game, each track is a downhill slalom with a ski lift at the bottom which takes you back 
to the start for however many laps a track has. 
 
The tracks are varied, the first few taking place on snowy mountainsides, while the latter taking you 
to wackier locales such as grassy countryside, a desert and a theme park. The money collected on the 
course or won at the end of the race can be spent to buy better boards, which differ in stats, or to 
collect items/weapons while racing. There are also stunts that can be performed while racing which 
earn money as well, and certain parts of each course encourage the player to do so. 
 
Other modes include stunt mode, shoot mode and speed mode, all focusing on a particular part of the 
gameplay from the main game, and a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can race each other. There 
are also unlockables for dedicated players.

The Sequel to the famous snowboard simulation Snowboard Kids is a fun family sports game. It combines 
a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. 
 
Player can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming 
modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite 
basic, sometimes similar to the Kirby series concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, 
just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. 
 
Winning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on 
improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like 
parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great 
power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in 
freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.

Space Invaders (c) Nov 30, 1999 Z-Axis, Ltd. / Activision, Inc. 
 
In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was 
based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years 
later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And 
none too soon, because the Invaders are back! 
 
Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and 
Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays 
close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. 
 
You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly 
rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the 
Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, 
and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting 
four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships 
that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups 
like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a 
unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original 
coin-op.

Space Station Silicon Valley (c) Oct 21, 1998 DMA Design Limited / Take-Two Interactive Software, 
Inc. 
 
Long ago, scientists created a living space station, full of animals. After its launch into space, 
the station vanished, never to be seen again. 
 
Until now. 
 
The station has reappeared out of no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision 
course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are 
now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time. 
 
Sadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot 
that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to 
attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains 
of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog. 
 
As you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all 
shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo's chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and 
abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching 
tigers. 
 
Aims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the 
rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action. 
 
When the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.

Spider-Man (c) Nov 20, 2000 Neversoft Entertainment, Inc. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: 
The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and 
similar character designs. 
 
Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an 
imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the 
sinister motives behind the device's theft. 
 
This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous 
other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain 
America. 
 
Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like 
swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating 
his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited 
though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also 
prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic 
environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads 
of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard. 
 
Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with 
direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl 
web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  
There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based. 
 
Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door 
types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police. 
 
There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man 
costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

StarCraft 64 (c) Jun 13, 2000 Blizzard Entertainment Inc.|Mass Media, Inc. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the 
edge of the galaxy. Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has 
maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find 
themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To 
further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered 
Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come. 
 
The N64 port of StarCraft is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, 
Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, 
and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks 
the cutscenes and map editor of the original game. 
 
If the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire Brood Wars expansion is also available. 
One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode 
(with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.

Star Fox 64 (c) Jun 30, 1997 Nintendo EAD / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Fox McCloud returns to once again rid evil from the Lylat System in this 64-bit remake of the SNES 
hit. 
 
The main aim of the game is to fly your Arwing through many levels of deadly enemies and huge end 
bosses with three wingmen (Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, and Falco Lombardi) following to help you out. 
Every once in a while, you will also use the Blue Marine submarine and the Landmaster tank. 
 
The 15 levels range from forward scrolling levels (much like Panzer Dragoon or some elements of Star 
Wars Arcade) to full 3D arenas, each with a certain goal to achieve or boss to destroy. The bigger 
your frags are at the end of each level determines which direction you take on the universe tree, 
which is split into three levels: easy, medium, and hard. All three link back to the end for the 
final level. 
 
Multiplayer modes are also included, allowing four people to battle in Arwings, or if you complete 
every objective in the single player missions, they can battle on-foot, where the four main 
characters run around with laser cannons.

Star Soldier - Vanishing Earth (c) Dec 15, 1998 Hudson Soft Company, Ltd. / Electro Brain Corp. 
 
Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth takes place in the far future, where you are the last hope for Earth, 
which is being attacked by an alien race.  The game features a top-down 3D scroller, similar to that 
of the arcade games 1943 or  Raiden.  You can take control of different space crafts, each with 
different advantages and disadvantages, and different weapons.  The rule is 1 hit-kill.  After 3 
lives, you have to restart the level.  There is no saving feature, however a lengthy password is 
provided to you at the end of each level, so long you have the patience to put it in each time you 
turn off the game. 
 
Each level is about 3-5 minutes long, each with it's own tough boss at the end.  Each level has its 
own secret path to take, depending on what you shoot (ex. shoot wall, reveal secret path).  All 
levels lead up to a final boss in the end.

Star Wars - Shadows of the Empire (c) Dec 03, 1996 LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC / Nintendo of 
America Inc. 
 
Set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire tells 
the story of Prince Xizor's quest to replace Darth Vader as the leader of the Sith, and wipe out the 
Rebels' chances of victory. The only man that can stop him is the interstellar bounty hunter Dash 
Rendar. The game is based on the novel of the same name, with locations including ice planet Hoth, 
Mos Eisley and the sewers of Imperial City, all in full 3D. 
 
Levels each have very different objectives, ranging from piloting snowspeeders on Hoth and racing 
speeder bikes on Tatooine to shooting stormtroopers and droids on foot throughout the galaxy. Dash 
primarily uses a blaster with unlimited ammo, but can also find more powerful weapons with limited 
ammunition. Each level has optional "challenge points" that are hidden throughout the level, and 
finding all of them will unlock a cheat dependent on which difficulty setting the save file is on.

upgrading your car. 
 
The cars themselves are a mix of the future and the past, with a hot rod style outside with a 
powerful new age engine inside. That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of 
speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly. 
 
A 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the 
competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes

Winnie the Pooh plans a party and therefore he needs honey. His friend Tigger promises to help him 
and starts searching for honey pots. 
 
Tigger's Honey Hunt is a platform action game in which the player guides Tigger through nine levels. 
In six levels the goal is to collect a predetermined minimum amount of honey pots in order to get 
access to the next level. In the other three levels there are  mini-games like Rock-Paper-Scissors, 
to play against other characters from Winnie the Pooh's world. 
 
Tigger is able to jump horizontally and vertically (even higher after he has learned special skills), 
use spider webs to jump to higher areas or to cross water or chasms with the help of turtles or 
levitating leaves. Beginning with three lives, Tigger needs to avoid being touched by dangerous 
creatures like bees or falling into chasms. When there are no lives left, Tigger restarts at the last 
checkpoint that has been passed. 
 
Additionally you can find secret areas with even more honey pots, collect pictures which you can 
later look at in your photo album and meet other characters who talk to you or need your help (e.g. 
finding Eeyore's lost tail).

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (c) Aug 20, 2002 Neversoft Entertainment, Inc. / Activision Publishing, Inc. 
 
Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, 
and a whole new level of graphics. 
 
The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune 
Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam 
Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course). 
 
The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, 
like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair. 
 
And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans 
blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items 
around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild 
and wacky tricks as you can.

Top Gear Rally 2 (c) Dec 03, 1999 Saffire Corporation / Kotobuki System Co., Ltd. 
 
The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the 
original Top Gear Rally. 
 
Along with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship 
cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving 
your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can 
be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully 
is important. 
New sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing 
the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money. 
 
Much like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you 
must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to 
the next stage and the bigger cup challenges. 
 
You can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to 
the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, 
as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.

Turok 2 - Seeds of Evil (c) Dec 10, 1998 Iguana Entertainment, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is the sequel to Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. 
Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. 
Unfortunately the blast awakens an even deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his 
freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the core of the Lost Land. Once again a Turok is tasked 
with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. 
 
The game features an armory twice as large as its predecessor, and many weapons will even have a 
later update that makes them even more devastating. New weapons include the lethal discus Razor Wind, 
a proximity mine layer, and the Cerebral Bore, a flying grenade that homes in on an enemy's head, 
drills through their skull, and then explodes. Enemies have damage models now, allowing limbs to be 
torn off or bloody holes to be blasted through torsos. Turok won't be facing any human opponents this 
time, but will find himself under attack by plenty of dinosaur/human hybrids, brutish giants, and 
man-sized insectoids. 
 
The goal of each level is to reach the end and defend one of the five totems that keeps the Primagen 
captive in its ship as well as finding keys to unlock the portals that lead to later levels. In each 
level Turok can also find a special spiritual power, such as immunity to lava or a long jump. After 
finding a power, he will need to return to an earlier level to use that power to find one of the five 
keys that opens the portal to the Primagen itself. While searching for spiritual powers Turok will 
occasionally find portals that transport him to a strange place full of deadly creatures who appear 
to be unaffiliated with the Primagen, but discovering their true purpose is the job for another 
Turok. 
 
A multiplayer game is included as well, with options for between 2 and 4 players and game-types like 
deathmatch and capture-the-flag. This multiplayer mode would later be expanded into a full game with 
Turok: Rage Wars.

Turok 3 - Shadow of Oblivion (c) Aug 31, 2000 Acclaim Studios Austin / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed in Turok 2: Seeds of Evil the resulting explosion created 
a shockwave throughout the universe. This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a 'thing' that 
drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new 
world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the 
pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. 
 
The third title in the Turok series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok 
lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same 
levels, as Joseph's small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while 
Danielle's magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to 
basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything 
they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and 
floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to 
collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next. 
 
Turok 2's multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each 
playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.

Instead of the usual Turok single player missions, you must control your character and complete 
certain missions (from getting the most frags in a time limit, finding an item, or lasting the 
distance). Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of 
more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives. 
 
Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from 
(frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like 
the single player missions) time trials and frag fests.

Vigilante 8 (c) Mar 17, 1999 Luxoflux Corp. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of 
world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the 
shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His 
job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR 
can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of 
Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep 
OMAR from succeeding. 
 
Choose from 8 characters with different endings with cars 
ranging to classic 70's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. 
Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3 hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden 
characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it's at. The PSX version allows 2 players, 
while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.

War Gods is a one-on-one fighting game that takes place in 3D environments. The fighter under your

Furthermore, the fighters all have special "finishing moves" that eliminate your opponent in some 
gruesome manner at the end of a match.  There are 10 different fighters to choose from, all based on 
different ancient civilizations. 
 
The graphics in War Gods are fairly unique. They were created by texture-mapping 3D character models 
with digitized photos of people.  This gives them a reasonably lifelike look.

and fly off ramps. Don't race alone. Challenge a friend in two-player mode! 
 
Wave Race 64's nine challenging courses are packed with marker buoys, ramps, mines, hairpin turns, 
sand spits and more. As you proceed through Championship mode's three difficulty levels, the courses 
get tougher and your rivals become more aggressive. Things start out easy in the tranquil lagoon of 
Dolphin Park. Soon, you'll battle the slanting light of Sunset Bay, race through the fog banks of 
Drake Lake, skip from wavetop to wavetop in the choppy Marine Fortress course, make a late-night run 
through the neon-lit Twilight City, skid across the ice floes of Glacier Coast and even fight 
Southern Island's treacherous tide! 
 
In Stunt mode, you'll master dazzling tricks while riding through red-and-white rings. You can do a 
handstand and roll, flip or helicopter your Jet Ski. If you're good enough, you'll even get to ride a 
dolphin! Test yourself in Time Trial mode.  Wave Race 64 gives you a choice of four riders, each 
graded according to four capabilities: grip, handling, acceleration, top speed and collision 
stability. You can customize each rider's Jet Ski and even select how rough the waters are. You can't 
do that in real life! 
 
You can save your circuit progress, best times and custom settings on the Game Pak, then transfer the 
results to a Controller Pak and play at a friend's house.

find. 
 
You can create your own wrestler, modify an existing wrestler, or choose from a large collection of 
WCW talent, competing for special championship belts, or hardcore matches where every win opens up 
hidden secrets.

Wetrix (c) Jun 12, 1998 Zed Two Game Design Studio / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The idea for this game is that you must build barriers on the arena to stop the water from leaking 
out. As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as 
possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the 
water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as 
possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play 
against a friend.

This game is an interactive version of the popular U.S. quiz show Wheel of Fortune complete with 
hostess Vanna White. 
 
The game is played by trying to find a hidden word with only a few guesses allowed for the letters 
which is very similar to the pen and paper game Hangman. The other round which features the Wheel of 
Fortune involves you spinning the wheel which has various prizes both good and bad and whatever the 
pointer stops on when it stops revolving is what the player wins. This can be cash, a free spin or if 
you're very unlucky Bankruptcy which means you lose all the money you've earned up to that point. 
 
Up to 3 Players can play together in multiplayer mode

WipeOut 64 takes place between WipeOut XL (2097) and WipeOut 3 (2116), in the year 2098.  WO64 is 
essentially WipeOut XL 2 (or occasionally dubbed WipeOut XXL) in that most aspects of the game are 
the same as XL. Same selection of ships, same handling system but using the analog control stick 
instead of the d-pad, even similar graphics. Don't think for a minute with all the similarities, that 
this is the same game by any means though... 
 
1. Piranha is now capable of using weapons 
2. Each team has a special weapon of their own 
Completely new tracks 
3. Graphics are infinitely smoother, more detailed as well 
4. AI has improved 
5. New music, primarily by a new Psygnosis in-house, "PC Music", but two additional songs by 
   Fluke, and one by Propellerheads

World Cup 98 (c) May 18, 1998 EA Canada|Software Creations Ltd. / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
The licensed game of the 1998 Football World Cup held in France from June 10 to July 12, the first 
World Cup licensed game distributed and developed by EA features a tweaked FIFA 98 engine, with all 
10 stadiums accurately designed and all 32 teams (plus 8 teams that failed to qualify but still 
deemed too important to leave out) featuring   real names and close "look-a-like" kits. Changes done 
to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI 
(including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is 
included, which affects simulated data: the team with higher ratings has a better chance of 
progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China. 
 
It's possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw,  randomize or customize them to 
the players' likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the 
first of the Classics matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition's history 
which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice 
penalty shootouts close the modes available. 
 
In the sound department, John Motson and Chris Waddle provide the commentary, Gary Lineker announces 
the next matches and BBC legend Kenneth Wolstenholme provides the commentary for classic matches. 
Chumbawamba, The Wizard of Oh, Boymerang and  Fluke provide the licensed tracks in the game.

Worms - Armageddon (c) Mar 30, 2000 Infogrames Lyon|Team17 Software Limited / Infogrames North 
America 
 
The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon 
expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet 
through Team 17's WORMNET. 
 
For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you 
control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your 
enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of 
Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to 
dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 
 
Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves 
and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do. 
 
Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, 
it's not a huge change.

WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ's first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. 
Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is 
the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances 
and Create A Wrestler feature. 
 
Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. 
All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and 
entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the "road to Wrestlemania" mode, 
an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other 
wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.

nearly as much speech. 
 
Features include custom player made wrestlers, as well as the real  wrestlers, many different game 
types (single player, multiplayer, royal rumbles, cage matches, etc.), but the career mode is where 
the action is, and you can build up your wrestlers strengths, and earn him belts.

Xena Warrior Princess - The Talisman of Fate (c) Dec 06, 1999 Saffire Corporation / Titus France SA 
 
Xena: Warrior Princess - Talisman of Fate is based on the TV-series Xena: Warrior Princess. The 
Nintendo 64 version of the series tie-in is a fighting game, unlike its PlayStation counterpart. 
 
The whole Xena universe is used in the game as all the levels and characters, except the new boss 
character, are familiar to the fans of the show. The action takes place in arenas which represent 
different kinds of surroundings with all the characters having their "own" level. 
 
The fighting is done with various weapons each character wielding his/her trademark weapon such as 
Xena's chakram, Gabrielle's staff and Callisto's sword. It includes most of the standard 
fighting-game modes such as story, vs. and training as well as a roster mode, where each player picks 
a succession of characters rather than just one. 
 
The fighting system is somewhat different from more traditional games.  The most obvious difference 
is that four players are allowed instead of two.  It can be a team battle or a free-for-all. The 
analog stick moves characters around on the ground in two dimensions, with separate buttons for 
block, jump and duck. The C-buttons handle attacks. Special moves are accomplished mostly by pulling 
the analog stick either toward your opponent, then away or vice-versa.

Yoshi's Story (c) Mar 09, 1998 Nintendo Co., Ltd. / Nintendo of America Inc. 
 
Loosely based on the Super NES classic Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story follows the adventures of six 
Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast 
oceans, and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby 
Bowser. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes 
place in storybook "pages" made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including 
cut-paper forests, denim clouds, inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools. 
 
Yoshi's Story pioneers use of the Rumble Pak as a key element of the game-play experience, as you'll 
be able to feel invisible but treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The 
Rumble Pak can also help you locate hidden fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells 
something. With a light touch of the Control Stick you can float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, 
and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.
