Description=Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally '1000 miles') is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game. <br><br>At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers; you can distribute points between Skill, Resistance and Mechanics, and choose the driver's favorite part of the race. <br><br>Atmospheric conditions change throughout the race: sometimes the weather will be clear, sometimes you'll have to drive through rain or mist. During the race, your car will sometimes lose a wheel or need other repairs. If this happens, you'll lose a couple of minutes repairing it - as long as you have the appropriate spare part; if you don't have one, it's game over!

The first task in achieving this is to find the required quantity of energy pods. Big Brother stored them on caverns under the surface of four planets, and it's your job to go and find them. You will have to negotiate through tight sections, using rotational controls where left and right changes the ship's direction and up and down change its speed. When you find a pod you must engage the ship's tractor beam to claim it.

Instead of humans monitoring other humans through the television screen, everything is controlled by a Central Computer. Smiffy decides to turn the computer off, and your adventure begins.<br><br>The game is a platform game.  In Orwell's book, gigantic buildings dominated the landscape, and whole worlds could be hidden inside them.  One of these buildings holds the Central Computer, and the game platforms are the corridors inside the building. You jump over monsters, duck flying objects, and work your way ever upward. Moving through the levels, you work toward the computer.<br><br>This game came out in 1983-84, when people were looking at Orwell's book, and seeing that his predictions were not perfect. Some felt that he had got his date wrong. This game plays on that idea, by moving the date back another ten years.

Next up is a shooting range, in which you look through a sightscreen to target the enemies (and avoid the innocent civilians) as they appear on the large screen in front of you. Driving through an assault course is your third task, with damage-inducing hazards to drive around and stars to collect for bonus points.

After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game's manual.  The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.<br><br>Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together.  Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis.  Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.  <br><br>Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith.  Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz.  If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.

Description=As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares.<br><br>There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).

The first part involves pressing a letter on the keyboard. Doing this will bring up a scene that includes something or someone beginning with that letter. Below this is information describing the scene. The word in uppercase letters is what is in that scene. Pressing the letter again will cause the game to draw it bigger over three lines.<br><br>Pressing a number takes children to the numbers section. Whatever number that is pressed will be printed in big letters on the right side of the screen. Like the first section, pressing the number again causes the game to print the number over three lines. Above this area is a blank picture, and when a number is pressed, a dragon will appear from the right side and flame the picture, causing the picture to reveal a picture with something resembling the number, and the dragon will be duplicated a number of times next to the picture depending on what number the child presses on the keyboard (unless they pressed the number '0').<br><br>Pressing the

Description=Based on the board game of the same name, two or more players are required to build hotels along a boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The hotels are constructed by placing markers that represent the growing floors of the hotels. The game progresses when players throw three dice, two standard numeric six-sided dice, and a special color die. The two numbers on the standard dice represents the total amount of money players can spend on construction, while the special die tells them that they can build in any color group. During the game, players can take over each other's hotels and get Fortune Cards, in which players can take advantage of construction bonuses, natural disasters, and other events to add and remove floors. As with the board game, the first player to pass $35 million in hotel property values wins the game.

To unlock these codes, Basildon must piece together several jokes, which are found in various rooms inside a television studio. Once Basildon has collected a joke, they must be entered in the main computer.<br><br>Collecting the jokes is not an easy task for Basildon. For one thing, to use certain objects, some other object must be collected first. For another, moving TV cameras roam around in some rooms, and if Basildon comes into contact with any of these, he returns to the computer room and ten minutes of his time is lost. <br><br>However, to deal with the cameras, Basildon is equipped with ten Cooperblasters which can be used to summon Cooperman. Once Cooperman has been summoned, the player is free to navigate him toward the camera, and once Cooperman comes into contact with the camera, it is destroyed. If the player leaves and re-enters the room, the cameras return and the player has to summon Cooperman again, wasting precious Cooperblaster ammo. Cooperman can only be summoned ten times, and the player is unable to collect more ammo, so they need to use Cooperman wisely.<br><br>One summon out of ten introduces the player to another character known as Blunderwoman, who does far more damage than Cooperman because whereas Cooperman just flies from one side of the screen to the other in a straight line unless the player interferes, Blunderwoman flies diagonally across the screen and back again without the player's involvement, killing any cameras that she does not kill the first time.<br><br>The game ends when the five hours are over.

(Unfortunately, you'll have to take our word for it, as the game doesn't make much use of these qualities.)<br><br>As in the wacky movie, your goal here is ultimately to overcome a potentially planet-destroying bomb set by the Black Lectroids, inhabitants of Planet 10.  Unlike the movie, you don't accomplish this by overcoming the Red Lectroids from the 8th Dimension with the assistance of Team Banzai and the Blue Blaze Irregulars  -- instead you wander an eerily depopulated town to procure the necessary components (gasoline, sand, bauxite and "a special catalyst") to power up your oscillation overthruster-sporting jet-car and transmit cancellation codes to the bomb. The game uses a simple VERB NOUN text parser and, on some platforms, illustrates the scene with static images.

You have 5 seconds to place a tile (or a bomb) - if you wait too long, you lose one of four possible &quot;misses&quot;; when you lose them all, it's game over. When a marble passes through a pipe tile, this tile disappears. <br><br>The player receives a point for each placed tile, and 10 points when the marble passes through the pipes and reaches the checkered flag outside the playfield. Note that once the marble passes the flag, it will continue to roll through a small corridor outside the playfield and towards the entrance to the playfield again, so the game can be continued indefinitely.

Description=Alice in Wonderland is an adventure platformer based upon the two Alice books by Lewis Carrol and created using the same engine as Below the Root.  However, whereas that game had more of a focus on role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving.<br><br>Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, given the subject matter, riddles.  Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size.  <br><br>The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them.  Especially the game tries to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a preappointed hour when they will reappear.  The time can be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game.  Time is important because the game must be completed before the Red King wakes, although this isn't much of an issue especially since the game can be saved whenever and mistakes easily taken back.

Description=Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.<br><br>The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!) <br><br>Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same).  If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will "capture" that character (indicated by a yellow status light).  The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them.  If not, the captured character will be lost.<br><br>Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.

Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.<br><br>When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.<br><br>When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.<br><br>At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. <br><br>You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

Enemies enter the screen from the top and move at various directions and speeds toward the bottom (they bounce and change direction when hitting the left or right side of the screen). When hitting one of them they "split" into smaller ones, which may have a changed direction and movement speed (this is repeated for the first and sometimes for the second hit). The sprites created from a first hit will not leave the playing field but rather bounce from the bottom edge, but the smallest, created from a second hit, will vanish once they reached the bottom. Those sprites which weren't hit at all will re-enter the screen from the top. The overall number incoming enemies increases over time (as soon as one wave was completely destroyed). The game has some basic sound effects (laser and impact sounds), but no music.

Description=Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. <br><br>However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br><br>Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.<br><br>The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.<br><br>Archon can be played with either one or two players.<br>The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.

Description=In Nodes of Yesod, a monolith was discovered on the moon that transferred data vital to earth's security to an alien planet. After an attempt to destroy the monolith failed, it was transported to its creators the Ariatans. Now it is up to Charlie to travel to the planet Ariat and prevent the Ariatans from accessing the data.<br><br>Gameplay in Arc of Yesod is very similar to its predecessor. Seen from a side-scrolling perspective, Charlie has to explore many large caverns, filled with enemies and transporters, and find eight crystals that he hopes will help him destroy the monolith for good. To get rid of his enemies, he can once again control a device similar to the mole in Nodes of Yesod. Pressing up on the joystick releases a small sphere that can be moved across the screen (while Charlie stands still) and shoot at enemies. Once again, there are enemies that are immune to the sphere, including a spaceman who, when touched, takes away one of Charlie's crystals.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Even more dangerous are the three bad-tempered villains also present, who are trying to catch Emil.

Each hazard must be taken at the right speed, which you'll learn through experience.

Description=In Monty On the Run the intrepid coal thief Monty Mole fled to the rocky island of Gibraltar. However, the Intermole agency is on to him, and his only hope of escape is to trek across Europe, collecting enough cash to buy the Greek island of Montoss and live there in luxury.<br><br>This is Monty's third game, and the structure is similar to the previous two. It's platform and ladders based, with 80 screens each representing some area of Europe - the Eiffel Tower and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are among the identifiable landmarks. <br><br>There are different ways of travelling through the levels - some bouncy platforms coupled with a new super-leap move allow for big progress to be made, while Monty can also suspend from the ceilings and dodge his way across. Monty can now fall without being hurt, although landing on water can cause multiple lives to be lost in quick succession.<br><br>There are many items to collect  - the most important are Eurocheques for money and airplane tickets. Once on a plane you must fight off the encroaching Intermole planes for extra points.

You can deal with the miners by using a pickaxe to knock them unconscious for a few seconds. If you are trying collect a money bag but a railcar gets in your way, you can cling onto the ceiling while it passes by. If you drop off the handholds on the ceiling at the right time, you can also ride the railcar to avoid the miners.<br><br>Once you do collect all the bags of money in one scene, you simply move your wheelbarrow to the next scene. In fact, you can go between the 3 scenes at will; you do not have to collect all the money bags in one scene in order to proceed to the next. In the last two scenes, you have to use elevators to get from Point A to Point B. Be warned: you can only carry one money bag at a time, and the weight of the bag makes you move slowly, making it a lot easier for miners to catch you. Also remember that time is against you, but if you manage to dump a bag in the wheelbarrow, you are given more time.<br>    There is a special money bag (worth more points) inside a blocked off room, in the middle screen. You need the pickaxe to break through the wall to get it, but it is very heavy, and slows you down much more than a regular money bag.

Description=This puzzle game features four players, any number of which can be human or computer, and is viewed from an isometric perspective. The basic gameplay is very similar to Virgin's Spot license. Your aim is to take control of the largest area of the board, which is done by moving your pieces so as for them to be next to pieces of another colour, which will then become your colour. There are three types of move – short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 100 levels, which needn't be played in sequence. The board layouts feature gaps in, which must be incorporated into your strategy, to ensure that you don't leave a space next to a large number of your pieces, which would allow an opponent to swallow them up.

Description=Batalyx is a set of six mini-games in a single package from legendary coder Jeff Minter. Completing levels and sections of the mini-games earns part of a completion icon, with the game finished when five icons are complete. There is an overall time limit represented by a decreasing bar. The six games were:<br><br>1) Hallucino-bomblets. The player controls a probe that moves by firing in the opposite direction. A variety of strange enemies <br>including floppy disks and pints of beer are out to stop the player. Shooting enemies earns credits, colliding with them reduces the number of credits. When the credit bar is full, part of the completion icon is awarded.<br><br>2) AMC2 (Attack of the Mutant Camels 2) pits the player against the giant camels again. The radar shows where the camels are, and they must be shot repeatedly to destroy them before they reach the base at the right-hand end of the level. Completing a level leads to the warp section, where the player must avoid the missiles.<br><br>3) Activation of Iridis Base - the player must follow a sequence of joystick moves (with and without the fire button) to control the photons, a bit like the electronic game Simon. The Iridis Base is actually a pyramid, and the player views the game from the back of a camel riding towards it.<br><br>4) Cippy on the Run - The goat-like creature from Ancipital returns. It must turn all the floor and ceiling tiles to a rainbow colour to complete the level. Cippy fires constantly to kill enemies, which change the floor tiles if they come into contact. Bad tiles include the gaps and "non-sticky" surfaces<br><br>5) Synchro II - possibly the hardest of the six games. A series of patterened squares are on the background and the player moves all of a pattern at once by holding fire and moving the joystick. The aim is to synchronise the floor movement to stop the enemy probes floating around from moving.<br><br>6) Psychadelia 2 - not strictly a game, more of a pause mode/extra. A small light synthesizer, allowing the player to change background colour, symmetry and line length.

A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.

Description=Battles of Napoleon is a historical wargame that lets you play either side in four of Napoleon's famous battles -- Auerstadt, Borodino, Quatre Bras, and the infamous Waterloo. Additionally, the game features a detailed scenario construction set that will allow you to design your own battles; everything from maps, to troop types, to weapon ranges and damage.<br><br>Gameplay is turn-based, each turn consisting of different phases. During your turn, you can establish various objectives (map squares to occupy) for each unit or commander, move commanders between units, move a unit, change formation, and, of course, attack or retreat. The Borodino scenario is the smallest, and can be used as a &quot;tutorial&quot; of sorts before moving on to the larger, more complex scenarios. This is a game that fans can legitimately spend several hours on.<br><br>The construction set allows, as you might expect, the creation of new scenarios for the game. In it, you will find the standard map and unit editors -- however, SSI allows you to make changes down to the weapon and unit type. This allows you to create scenarios for virtually any type of battle you can think of. As a silly example, it is possible to take the stock weapon &quot;musket&quot;, change the damage and range, and rename it &quot;laser rifle&quot; -- you then have the makings of a futuristic battle on your hands. (Of course, you would need to modify just about everything else to complete such a scenario... but you get the idea.)<br><br>The learning curve for this game is steep; it is probably not for the faint of heart. Anyone who enjoys getting shoulder-deep into battlefield strategy and tactics, though, will feel very comfortable with this game.

Description=Beamrider is a 3-D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!

Description=Below the Root is based on Zilpha Keatley Snyder's fantasy book series "The Green-Sky Trilogy". Following the events in those books, The Kindar and the Erdling societies have joined together. However unrest and distrust still remains. An old woman, D'ol Falla has heard the words "The Spirit fades, in Darkness lying. A quest proclaim, the Light is dying". Choosing one of five available people (of different ages and of either Kindar or Erdling descent) either she believes can help, D'ol Falla assigns the quest of discovering what these words mean and how to quell the racial and political tensions building between the races.<br><br>Below the Root is a adventure game and a platform game. Choosing one of five characters (each very different from one another), the player explores the tree-based lands Erdling and the underground-based lands of the Kindar. As an adventure game, goals are primarily accomplished by talking to people (though each character is treated differently by others) and finding the right items to use in specific situations, but also dealing with the challenges of level design in a platform game.<br><br>Each character can obtain different items to help with their movement as well as psychic abilities such as pensing (telepathy), kiniporting (telekinesis) and grunspreking (plant manipulation). Violence is abhorred among the Kindar and the Erdling and violent actions tend to harm the player's reputation. Kindar or Erdling factions may kidnap the player's character if they wander into the wrong areas, throwing them into a local "prison house" from which they must escape. The player must eat constantly to retain their energy, however Erdling characters do not eat meat.

Dying reduced the stock of golden arrows by half. <br><br>The player aimed by moving the joystick while holding fire, which changed the elevation bars in the side borders.

Description=Based on the movie of the same name. You have been assigned by the police force to track down and eliminate any replidroids that have landed on Earth. There are six types of replidroids, labeled Replidroid 1 through 6. The higher the number, the more intelligent it is.<br><br>The majority of the game is viewed from inside your skimmer, and inside of your skimmer are three displays that you need to pay attention to. The main display displays a radar view of your area, allowing you to navigate the streets in search of replidroids (which are represented by octagons with crosses inside them). To the right of this is a smaller display which shows the whole city and your position in relation to the replidroid's. Below this is a text readout giving information on the number and type of replidroids within the vicinity.<br><br>In the main display, your position is represented by a yellow cursor which you can use to navigate the streets with. If you find a replidroid, you can hover over it and press the fire button. Doing so will put you in pursue mode where you automatically land. <br><br>After you get out, you must hunt down said replidroid in a busy street. There is a scanner in which you can use to keep track of where it is. The replidroid is represented as a green square. The further you progress, the closer you are to them. If the replidroid gets out of range, your skimmer automatically picks you up, and you have to hunt down replidroids elsewhere. Once you catch up with it, you must match your position with theirs and shoot at them in order to get the bounty displayed in the status bar. Your scanner also shows oncoming traffic that must be avoided. What it does not show, however, is people which you must dodge. If you crash into people, the game ends.

Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes.  The pilot survived, and in the process shot down seven enemy fighters.  He shot down thirteen more the next month.  For these actions, Germany offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth down—and Chatsworth got a new nickname—Blue Max.<br><br>As Blue Max, you go out on sorties—flying missions—attacking assigned targets.  Targets include bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships.  You progress to new missions as you take out your targets.<br><br>You must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for you.  Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in semi-suicidal bombing runs.  The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground.  In the middle of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb.  There were problems of coordination, found in the game as well—if you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash.<br><br>This game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany.  In the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.

Description=Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.

In these countries, where all strangers are suspect and all actions observed, paranoia and vulnerability are inescapable. In these countries, innocent travelers get caught in the web of international espionage. This is the setting for Border Zone. Border Zone consists of three chapters. In each chapter, you play a different character (an American businessman, a Western spy, and an Eastern spy) involved in unique puzzles and goals. The chapters take place at different times and at different locations; as a player, you will get the most satisfaction if you play the chapters in order. Border Zone has a built-in clock which drives the story forward. Unlike other Infocom stories, the clock in Border Zone continues to tick even while you stop to think. So if you find yourself in a dangerous situation, you can't just sit back and relax. Whether you type in a command or not, characters will move around, events will happen, and the story will proceed.

The first of which is to catch the bounces ball that bounces around the arena, and throw it through the goal slots, on your opponent's side of the screen.

Being knocked down reduces stamina, as  does straying too far into the other player's side of the screen, or colliding with the wall each player is attached to.  If either player runs out of stamina, they are unresponsive until they recover.

You can turn the paint mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is in it, unlimited times. Another way to trap the Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the Bucket Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The Bucket Chucker will then be stuck in the basement until you lose a brush.<br><br>Starting on building five, you must jump over steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a brush.

The game ends when either ship wins or at 6pm whichever comes first. You will win if you sink the enemy ship or accumulate enough points to force the enemy ship to surrender. You will lose if your crew size goes below 1/4th of its original size or if 11 enemy crew members manage to board your ship and you have no standing friendly crew members occupying any of the first 10 boarding positions on your ship. if both ships sink or no one wins by 6 pm the game is a draw.The game can be played by 2 people or against the computer.

Description=Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...<br><br>Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.

As he is brought up to date, he decides to join the New Earth Organization (NEO), to fight for his home planet.<br><br>Once he had fought in the cold war, a pilot sent into outer space to destroy a Russian weapons platform.  He was successful, but his success destroyed the planet, as nuclear war was launched, and you went into a centuries long cryogenic sleep, abandoned by the people who could not retrieve you.  In the centuries that he slept, Earth colonized the solar system.  There are large groups of people on Mars, Venus and Saturn.  The colonies once existed to bring resources back to an Earth that had problems sustaining itself.<br><br>But the intervening centuries brought a power shift.  Now Earth is at the Mercy of the interstellar alliance RAM—formerly the Russian-American Mercantile, but now the superpower, based on asteroids surrounding the planet Mercury.  Mercury exploits the Earth for resources, at the expense of Earth's population.  Earth has fallen into barbarism, except for one small light—the New Earth Organization (NEO).<br><br>These "rebels" consider themselves freedom-fighters, and they are fighting for Earth's freedom from the interstellar powers.  Call it patriotism, if you will, but Buck joins them—the only person alive who can remember when Earth was supreme and healthy.<br><br>Your first task is to create a party of six characters. Then, these six new NEO recruits are trained, and are thrust into the battle for Earth.

You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.<br><br>Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.

The game has a pause command, so you can examine the battlefield without pressure of time. Units are displayed as icons and represent a regiment, brigade or even division, each having a certain strength value. At the beginning the units are placed in their historical starting locations of Dec 16th, 1944. Orders are given by selecting an unit and pointing to a target on the map. The unit will then try to move towards the ordered location (or enemy unit), and engage into combat. During the course of the battle each side will receive a number of reinforcements appearing at predefined (historical) positions. Units will fight until completely wiped out. When this happens you will receive a message displayed in a ticker on the top of the screen. This is also the place where you receive information like weather reports, air support and incoming reinforcements.<br><br>Victory points are accumulated by destroying enemy units and taking cities (each city has a victory point value). There are some special conditions for the German side, like not taking the city of Spa in time (with intact fuel depot) will result in decreased combat value for all units. The current points are displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game will end on Jan 3rd, 1945, also showing the final points again, along with statements which sides claim victory. You can examine final unit positions and restart the game afterwards.

The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30,50,100 points.<br><br>Round 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times.<br><br>After these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase "keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 2 in a bed".<br><br>Once the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player)

Immediately after finishing your preparations and choosing to start the match, the result is calculated in a short sequence ("goal-counting"). This is accompanied by statistics about earnings and expenses related to the match day. Afterwards the results of the other matches are displayed, followed by the new ranking in the league table. Finally, the game will return you to the initial management menu.<br><br>The games' graphics is limited to the usage of the standard font / colors (it has a character color swapping effect in the title screen and a character scrolling effect in the game over screen, also switching colors in-between the scrolling).

Players can hold down the fire button to increase Caesar's speed so that they can easily catch the mice, but they must also avoid knocking the jars off the cupboard.<br><br>A timer is present, and it counts down during the game. The time increases for each mouse the player successfully carried to the larder door, but decreases when the mice completely eats the food, when players knock jars down, or when they try to move past the game screen. The game ends when the timer reaches zero.

Pressing the fire-button will rearrange the blocks that make up a stone. At least four blocks of the same color have to be lined up vertically, horizontally or diagonally in order to clear them. The more stones are cleared at once, the higher the score. A level ends after a set number of stones (which increases with every level) has been dropped.

Description=Playing a witch, you must assemble the six ingredients required to kill off your arch-rival, an evil pumpkin. The ingredients are all located in underground buildings, each of which can only be entered once you've found the appropriate key. The keys are located overground, and you must fly around on your broom to collect them.<br><br>The overground sections play like standard shoot 'em ups, as your broom is not affected by gravity and can fire bullets using your magic energy. Bats, fireballs and even seagulls are among the many creatures trying to stop you - contact will cost you more energy than shooting at them would. There are energy recharges on offer.<br><br>Once you go underground, the gameplay becomes a test of precision platform jumping, including some Manic Miner-esque blind jumps. The six underground sections can be completed in a variety of orders, but you will sometimes reach points that cna't be completed without objects from other sections, so a lot of back-tracking is required. Although you start with nine lives, they won't last all that long at first.

As the poem in the instructions sheet explains, the only way to put things right is to capture a lock of her hair, then take it to the cauldron and cast a spell to undo things.<br><br>Controlling the pumpkin is difficult at first, as it has a very high bounce, the exact level of which can be toggled using the 5 key. Direction can only be changed when the ball is on the ground. Ricocheting into enemies costs energy, and you only gain weaponry by landing into magic pools. The starting positions are random,  making mapping advisable and increasing the initial challenge.<br><br>Even then, enemies respawn quickly, so all you're doing is buying a little time to pass them. Others can't be shot, and must be passed by possessing the right object - possibly one of the 5 you will ultimately need to vanquish the witch.

Description=As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. <br><br>However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".

Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.<br><br>Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.

The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.

The player's task is to explore this city with a remote-controlled hoverdrone, called Monitor, while trying to avoid its automatic defense systems.<br><br>Monitor is controlled from a top-down perspective and can only be moved into four directions, holding down the fire-button enables it to shoot in eight directions.

Some can shoot in four, others in eight directions, while others only try to ram the monitor or attack with homing shots.<br><br>Pressing the fire-button twice and then holding it activates a capture probe that can be used to pick up items, operate switches and control hostile drones. Drones under Monitor's control follow it around and can be used as a shield against projectiles, a battering ram against other drones or a plug to prevent more enemies from emerging from a trap. Captured movable drones automatically move into the direction Monitor is firing in, but can also be locked in a relative position by pressing the space bar. In order to be able to capture a drone, a certain amount of energy is needed, depending on the type of the drone. Items to replenish energy can be picked up as well as better weapons like rapid-fire or two- or three-way fire.<br><br>There are eight cities to explore, each consisting of two floors connected via lift shafts.

There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.<br><br>The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.<br><br>To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've already done).<br><br>Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.

Description=Aimed to tie in with Halley's Comet passing close to Earth, but actually missing the boat by some time, The Comet Game is based on the idea of Halley's comet coming with bacterial life-forms capable of destroying life on earth. As a result, you must get into your high-tech spaceship, intercept the comet, and destroy those organisms. Controlling the ship's autopilot technology, you must ensure that the task is successfully completed.<br><br>You must ensure that missile attacks on the ship are unsuccessful (by shooting at the missiles before they hit a your ship, a la Missile Command, controlling a cross-hair that moves around the ship), and maintain communication with Earth, by aiming the comms beam in the right direction to get the best signal. <br><br>Keeping the computer running smoothly requires moving a line of LEDs to match what is being displayed. The fourth ongoing task is to keep the ship's crew happy. This is done in a rather surreal way, by brewing coffee and injecting it into the crew (who are in suspended animation).

All words formed are accurately scored. The game can juggle your tiles and allow you to manually rearrange them, and you can watch the computer 'think' as it notices possible moves and their scoring. There are four difficulty levels, with the highest capable of combined scores over 700.

Impressively complex for its time, the simulation calculates a day-night-cycle, weather, terrain, supply lines, formations, unit organization and experience, to name only the most important factors. Two players can compete head to head on one computer, soloists may randomize the enemy priorities in some scenarios for added uncertainty on the battlefield.<br><br>Even more so than in the previous games, designer duo Sid Meier and Ed Bever stress the educational aspect of their well-researched historical simulation: the manual is desgined as a complementary read that offers extensive background information to the five scenarios and their 'what if' variants.

Because of the first explosion some doors between rooms were blocked or damaged: Find the needed technical tool sets for example to fix such issues.<br>Once you have found the core room, use the abilities of your different droids and the - hopefully found - correct tools to damp down the temperature and stop the disaster.

Over the course of a few days you need to cultivate a familiarity with the layout of the castle and the nocturnal activities of its primary resident, who chooses to make midnight snacks of you rather than a main course.  An unpredictable day/night cycle forces your hand, necessitating finding a reliable light source and some means of staying awake -- or else you awaken the next morning back in bed, your possessions pilfered by the kleptomaniacal creature of the night and your neck boasting irritated bite marks.  Each day you must incrementally approach your goal of overcoming the Count, lest you wind up as one more dried-out apéritif.

Description=Creatures 2: Torture Trouble follows on from the events in Creatures. Clyde Radcliff, after eliminating the demons and saving his fellow Fuzzy Wuzzies in the previous game, has settled down with 'Fuzzette' Bonnie, and they have 9 children. Unfortunately, some demons had escaped and decide to take revenge by kidnapping their children and everyone else in their village. Clyde must rescue them all, and wipe out the demons.<br><br>The game abandons the scrolling levels of the original, although it retains the torture chambers, where Clyde must manipulate the objects in the single screen level to save one or more of his family and friends.  <br><br>The various attack modes that Clyde has are now upgraded by picking up potions on the torture chamber levels, rather than getting them from the witch, as in the original. Also, bonus coins can be picked up on most levels, and collecting 5 of them earns an extra life.<br><br>The game is made up of three islands. A Torture chamber level is followed by an interlude, where Fuzzy Wuzzies are thrown from a high ledge. Here Clyde and the Fuzzy he last rescued bounce the other Fuzzies to safety on another ledge, whilst avoiding bouncing a Fuzzy into the clutches of a flying demon. They must bounce a certain number of Fuzzies to safety in the time limit.<br><br>After a further torture chamber level and accompanying interlude, Clyde is captured by a family of 3 demons. He must destroy them in turn, by kicking bugs so they are sucked into the ACME vacuum machines, and fired at the demons, while avoiding what the demons are dropping on him. The demons are faced in order of increasing size and power.<br><br>The final level on all but the third island involves Clyde transporting Fuzzies from this island to the next. Clyde has scuba gear, so can go underwater, but must carry the other Fuzzies over the top of the water, whilst avoiding various demons that might attack the Fuzzies or Clyde. There are islands in the middle that act as drop-off points.

Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.<br><br>The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers.  The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes.  He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.<br><br>The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages.  The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis.  At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.<br><br>The final stage on each level is a torture chamber, which takes place on a single screen.  Here Clyde must stop one of his friends being killed by the demons, who are using some sort of ACME device.  This is a puzzle game stage, where you must use the items in the room to kill one of the demons threatening Clyde's friend.  Clues can also be bought from the witch.  Whatever the outcome, either death will be gory, although the cartoony graphics of the game means that things aren't really graphic.

Description=After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.<br><br>Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.<br><br>Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released.

Energy is lost when players come into contact with an inhabitant. Up to three weapons can be used to destroy the inhabitants. Once all the droids have been collected, players make their way to the next planet where new inhabitants are introduced and the number of droids to be collected increases.

Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.

The penalty shoot-out involves timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the angle of the shot. In the ski-jump, timing the launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war involves choosing a candidate you feel you can beat and then out-waggling them.<br><br>In the triple jump you must run to the line before holding down fire for the right length of time for each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is optimal). The hurdles event involves running to and pressing fire to clear the hurdles. <br><br>Pistol shooting gives you limited time to correctly move a sight into position, before firing as close to the centre as possible.

Equipped with a jetpack, a short-ranged beam weapon and a limited number of bombs, you must reach the exit before running out of energy. The amount of energy available is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It depletes over time and when the jetpack or the beam weapon is used. When navigating through the caves, you must avoid contact with enemies, spikes and other deadly objects. The beam weapon can be used to dispatch enemies, while bombs are used to destroy walls. If you have run out of bombs, you can also use the beam weapon to destroy walls, which uses up a lot of energy. <br><br>In the final level, a Tetris-inspired puzzle has to be solved. However, instead of clearing lines, the goal in this case is to fill up the lower part of the screen without leaving a gap.

The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.

Description=Deactivators is an arcade-puzzle maze game which puts you in control of a squad of bomb disposal droids. You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential.<br><br>Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required significantly.

Description=Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.<br><br>After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.<br><br>The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.<br><br>The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.

Description=There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.<br><br>Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.

Description=Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. <br><br>In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.<br><br>In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.

The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives - although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.

In 1987 all UK records of the Department of Health and Social Security, Police and State Security are then coordinated in a central data bank. The year after, passport, censorship operations and communications were integrated. By 1994, the computer controlled all defense and internal security. Tuesday evening, the machine rebelled ...<br><br>Players take control and follow the life of a "defect", in the shape of a human body, that has formed inside the machine. It is taken through all stages of life, from cells to senility, with many quotes from and references to William Shakespeare's The Seven Ages of Man from the play As You Like It ("All the Screen's stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, and one person in their time plays many parts, their Acts being Seven Ages"). The game is advertised as audio-visual entertainment. It contains no sound, but there is a cassette tape that needs to be played along with the game. Both sides contain 23 minutes of sound, forming 46 minutes which is also the length of the game as it is meant to be played in a single sitting. The tape's soundtrack contains singing, musical compositions, and speeches by a number of famous voice actors. They vaguely clarify the different stages of the game and often tease the player based on what is happening. The full transcript of the speech is also included in the manual.<br><br>The player has to guide the defect through the different stages of life, constantly followed by the defect police. The game cannot be lost, but based on a number of actions a percentage shown all the time will vary. The player's controls consists of four directions, and the combination can form diagonal movement. The effect of the controls is different for every screen. Deus Ex Machina is based on a number of vignettes with limited gameplay. There are no win conditions for any part and controls do not appear to affect the game's progress. Screens have the player move a green dot between strings of DNA, ward off the defect police examining the body, jump over words such as "LIES" or "WAR" - where the relevance and atmosphere is generally provided through the background soundtrack. The game can be played without sound, but it does not make any sense that way. There are in-game instructions to synchronize and turn the tape.

Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don’t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time.

Description=Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Description=Dino Wars is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess, with combat decided by action scenes. If you ever played Archon you know the idea behind this game.<br><br>On a chess-like board (9x10 pieces in this game) you move different sorts of dinosaurs. If you hit an square on which an opponent dinosaur stands, the game changes to action mode. This is played as a beat-'em-up, in which you must beat the opponent dinosaur to win the square. Each dinosaur has it's own strategies, movement restrictions and different combat skills - which are roughly based on the historical properties of the real dinosaurs. As a result, knowing which dinosaurs are likely to win combat is crucial to the strategy.<br><br>The action scenes can be played independently of the main strategic game.

Description=This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.<br><br>The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.<br><br>Scrooge’s office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.<br><br>You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It’s these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There’s also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who’s winning between you and Glomgold.<br><br>You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill … Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.<br><br>Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.<br><br>The jungle features Scrooges’ nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus’ backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.<br><br>Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.<br><br>Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge’s niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.<br><br>Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.

In this game, like all Dizzy adventure games, gameplay is standard platformer fare, except there inventory items scattered around the world, which are necessary to overcome obstacles and progress through the game. The world expands in all four compass directions, items are frequently far away from the obstacles they are used on, and you can only hold one item in your inventory at a time (later games gave you more baggage space), so much backtracking is necessary!<br><br>One thing unique about the first Dizzy game is that there are MANY more monsters and hazards in this one than in later Dizzys. Also unique is that some inventory items are used to destroy monsters. For example, one of the first inventory items you find is birdseed. As long as birdseed is the item in your inventory, you destroy any birds you touch. But this made it necessary to juggle items excessively often, so the concept was dropped from the sequels in favor of more inventory-based puzzles.

When surfacing for air the dolphin must also avoid being caught in the nets of a tuna boat.<br><br>The player must find a “color current” below the surface, a sort of tunnel through which their dolphin must swim without being pushed out by the strong current.  Success is rewarded with a visual insight (dream) into the meaning of life and dolphin lore.  This is accompanied by a particular pattern of dolphin clicks and whistles that is important to remember.<br><br>Next the player must find a particular color current in the ocean, from which emanates the click and whistle phrase heard in the dream.  Successfully swimming through this color current leads the dolphin to the seabed.  There the player must find a mysterious rune, which might be a particular fish or piece of coral reef, and touch it.  This releases a fragment of hieroglyph that appears on the bottom of the screen.<br><br>The player must then arrange the hieroglyphic characters in the proper order, using the “Dolphinese-English dictionary” found in the printed manual.

The player then finds the next corresponding color current, seabed rune, and hieroglyph fragment, and so on until all nine hieroglyph fragments are found and solved.  Supposedly, the hieroglyph puzzle, when completely solved, gives clues to where, in real life, there was an actual pearl hidden somewhere in America.

There are two parallel universes (the "good" and "bad" - or "modern" and "ancient", if you prefer - versions of the universe), and you get sent from one universe to another at times. Part of the game is to collect items from these mirror worlds that have been swapped, and return them to their correct places, thus restoring the balance. In addition to this, you also need to shoot a lot of aliens before they shoot you, culminating with the fight against the big alien end monster.

This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.<br><br>The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. <br><br>There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.

Here you try to negotiate with Lord Holders of Craftsmasters to make allies in your fight against the Thread. You can facilitate negotiations by organizing special events: To win the confidence of a Lord Holder who fancies dragons, invite him to a Hatching. Weddings also provide opportunities to score diplomatic points. <br>When diplomatic maneuvers fail you, you may be forced to resort to a duel -- a wounded leader is unable to take any actions for a long time --, but this may jeopardize your status with peaceful leaders. Finally, conclaves may be called up after certain events like the death of a Weyrleader. A Dragonrider conclave will cancel all ongoing events for all Weyrs. A Lord Holder conclave will only cancel events involving Lord Holders and the Master Harper. Time passes in realtime during the strategic phase, but you can pause the game.<br><br>Thread fighting occurs at the end of each year. During this phase of the game, you mount your dragons and you must pursue the falling Thread and char it in midair with the dragon's fiery breath before it lands.

Description=Old software (where adult text adventures are concerned, perhaps second only to Softporn Adventure!) proves to be a gateway to what was a nostalgic experience even then, the heterosexual rite of passage: a night of heavy petting and perhaps "getting to third base" in a parked car at the local drive-in movie theatre.  The order of the day here is pacing yourself, gradually building your girlfriend's ardour before taking it to the back seat and freeing yourselves of some of that cumbersome clothing.  Oh, say!  Is that my hand?  How did that get there?

Description=Drol is a platform game where you play a cute robot that can fly and shoot. Your goal is to rescue children that are wandering around each level. The levels consist of rows of platforms, with gaps which can be jumped through to go up or down a vertical level. The creatures to avoid and shoot vary from strange hopping, beer-belly aliens, to demons, snakes, and axes flying through the air (we never do find out who's throwing those axes!).<br><br>Like Defender, Drol incorporates a "radar"  at the top of the screen, so you can find the children and dodge incoming baddies.

The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.<br><br>The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. <br><br>Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.

As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. <br><br>The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. <br><br>The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. <br><br>On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. <br><br>The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.

To make things more difficult there's a hippo in the water swimming around (always where the bubbles on the surface are). If the hippo catches the boat the player loses a life. After 10 ducks are delivered to the beach they start to sing and the the game restarts, increasing the difficulty by making the ducks faster.

Description=Temple of Apshai is the first in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series of role-playing games series and one of the first computer role-playing games. <br><br>The game could be described as a graphical "roguelike", but actually it resembles the mainframe classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.<br><br>The game starts at the Innkeeper by creating a new character (if you already played the game, you can use characters that you created). You get different stat values (in Dungeons & Dragons style) as well as an amount of money that you can spend on weapons, armor and other equipment. Alternatively, you can just enter the stats to "import" characters from other role-playing games. (This is also used as a primitive "save / load game" mechanism.)<br><br>After character generation, you enter the dungeons. On the left, the current room of the dungeon is displayed; the character status and other info are displayed on the right. One thing that sets Temple of Apshai apart from other rpg is that the manual contains detailed room descriptions for each room (that may contain hints about traps or treasures), to create atmosphere despite crude graphics.<br><br>You move about and perform actions like opening doors, firing arrows, examining walls for secret doors etc. by pressing key commands. Moving is also done without cursor keys: You turn your character into the direction you want to go and then move him forward by 1 to 9 steps, also selectable by single keystrokes. But take care of fatigue: If you keep running all the time, your fatigue rises, and if it reaches 100%, you cannot move or act for some time -- which can be deadly in the presence of, say, a Giant Bombardier Beetle.<br><br>Each room may contain treasures to pick up (sometimes just trash, sometimes gold, sometimes useful items), secret doors which lead to hidden parts of the dungeon and traps, which obviously should be avoided (you can try to search for them). Of course, you will also encounter monsters -- a variety of undead or giant insects -- which you have to fight using turn-based combat. Apart from the normal attack, there is also the thrust (which is more effective, but risky), and you can also fire arrows at distance or parry. To avoid a fight, you may also try to speak to them.<br><br>If you return to the Innkeeper, you gain experience, which increases your stats. Still, if you quit the game, the only way to save your character is to write down the stats on paper and re-entering them the next time you play.

Description=You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.<br><br>Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:<br><br>1. Shooting them with his gun.<br>2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.<br>3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.<br>4. Crushing them with an elevator.<br><br>Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.<br><br>While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. <br><br>Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.<br><br>Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.<br><br>If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.

On each of the 9 levels, you fly to the right, over one of the cities; buildings which disappear to the left of the screen reappear on the right side. Due to the radiation your engines have limited power and you're slowly drifting towards the ground. You have to destroy the buildings quickly so that you won't bump into one. Crashing into a building or the ground is game over. Each level ends when all the buildings have been destroyed. <br><br>You can control your plane with a joystick by moving it left and right. Pressing FIRE drops a laser shot from the plane; the laser shot destroys any section of buildings it touches. <br><br>You receive score for destroying the buildings. When you destroy a building, you get 1 point. If you manage to destroy another, you receive 2 points; the third destroyed building gives you 3 points etc. This is however reset back to 1 point if your laser shot misses or when you start a new level.

Some parts of the track are blocked unless you can shoot through obstacles before reaching them, or hit a jump pad. At some points you can change to travelling along the ceiling as well.

Description=ELIZA was the first chatterbot to make a splash in popular culture, originally written and conceived by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT in 1966 to mockingly ape the style of a person-centered ("Rogerian") psychotherapist or counselor, largely by prompting the user to elaborate on topics sampled from previous user input.  A typical session would take the form of a typed dialogue (sometimes with simulated typing errors to further the suspension of disbelief), with the computer asking the user a series of questions and being fed responses from which to generate further questions.<br><br>ELIZA stimulated early consideration of computer artificial intelligence (or the appearance thereof), not infrequently passing the Turing test and fooling users into believing (for a little while, at least) that they were interacting with a real human being on the other end... blazing a trail subsequently followed down by Perry the Paranoid and Racter.  Additionally, the nods its conversational interface made toward natural language processing (or, again, the appearance thereof) are considered to have been influential on the early mainframe development of the interface for text adventure games such as Adventure and Zork.<br><br>Considered as a game, ELIZA is nearly the polar opposite to Emily Short's Galatea -- instead of the player probing the computer with questions, the computer probes the player with them.  Many different stories will still be revealed, but in this case, that's because it'll be people tricked by the program into telling them.

Description=Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. <br><br>Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). <br><br>For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. <br><br>As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. <br><br>Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.

The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match.<br><br>While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn't buy the Euro Championship license. You'll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the "Champions of Europe" title in a nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals.<br><br>Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at all.

While five members of the Enigma team: Zark, Sevrina, Syylk, Maul and yourself; escort Zoff to face the Emperor’s wrath, the war flares across the galaxy. As you cross the imperial border, Zoff concentrates his awesome psionic powers on the Enigma craft’s guidance system. Moments later the ship is bucking and burning through the atmosphere of a planet. You awake, head throbbing, to find the Enigma craft wrecked and General Zoff missing …<br><br>Gameplay is very similar to it's prequel Shadowfire. Take control of your four Enigma Force members, each with different abilities, and lead them through an underground complex filled with enemy soldiers and lots of puzzles. You will often need to combine the abilities of more the one crew member to solve a single puzzle. <br><br>The user interface is completely icon-driven. Only character movement and shooting is done directly with joystick. The game is in realtime and you often need to switch between the characters because the enemy troops also move to through the complex and attack. So, gameplay can be very hectic, and the overall difficulity is very high.

Percy appears in the middle of the maze. Four snowbugs also appear and start traveling around the maze, in an attempt to kill Percy. Percy needs to squash all snowbugs in the maze by pushing the ice blocks into them. The ice blocks can also be melted so that more space is created, allowing Percy to pass through. Any snowbug that touches the maze's electrified edges become dazed, allowing Percy to destroy them easily.

It also had large, detailed towns with many people to talk to, and a separate combat engine where your party fought multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.<br><br>The story? After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named "Exodus" before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon you the hero to find and stop him.

Description=This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.

Description=Expedition Amazon puts you in control of a team of 4 explorers on an expedition to map and study (i.e.: plunder) the ruins of the Incan civilization.  Your team consists of a Medic, a Field Assistant, a Radio Operator, and a Guard. After equipping your team with all the necessary supplies (don't forget the mosquito netting!) you travel to your base camp at the edge of the jungle where you will begin your journey.<br><br>You will quickly meet up with many of the hazards of the jungle as you explore, including hostile natives (hope your Guard is a good shot!), mosquitoes, disease, covered pits, wildlife, and more. Each of your team members has an "EL" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more effective at avoiding hazards. You also get an Efficiency Rating "ER" which is an overall score of your exploration completed and loot collected minus your money spent and the number of team members killed.<br><br>Once you have mapped a few sectors of jungle you will find some ruins with passages leading underground. Underground is a lot more hazardous than the jungle, as many of the pitfalls you encounter mean instant death if you don't have the proper equipment or your team was not alert. The natives are also a lot more numerous underground as well.  But don't worry, you can always replace members of your expedition. Besides, what does it matter if you lost your Field Assistant if the rest of your team is carrying out a bagful of gold and silver?

Occasionally when someone commits a nasty foul the game turns into a one-on-one fighting game; he who wins the fight can stay on the ice while the loser must spend some time in the penalty box.<br><br>Face Off! can be played with realistic rules, relaxed rules or with no rules at all. Other options available include the number of players per team, difficulty &amp; period length and whether or not you control the goalie during the Shot Cam mode.<br><br>Some minor coaching and management options are also included. You can design your own plays in the playbook, modify your lines, move players form your minor league team to your major league team and vice versa and make trades with the other teams in the league.<br><br>Face Off! doesn't have a NHL license, so all players and teams are fictional.

Partially controlled by CAIN (Cybernetic Artificially Intelligent Nexus), it performs different functions that include giving out information about the residents and artifacts to be found in the time zone, and notes any disturbances that have been detected. The ship is also used to travel to these time zones. You can leave the ship once you have arrived at the time zone.<br><br>Equipped with laser gun and a jet pack, you explore the time zone while searching for any artifacts. When found, these can be picked up by walking over them and pressing the fire button. Only one artifact can be carried at any given time, so whatever it is you are carrying must be returned to the correct chronological period.<br><br>In each time zone, you are constantly under attack by the inhabitants of that era, but the inhabitants can be destroyed with your laser gun. Extra powers can be gained by collecting tokens that randomly appear. There are two types of these. "Power of Will" immobilizes inhabitants for a few seconds, and "Thinkstrike" gives you temporary invisibility.<br><br>You only have a limited amount of time in each zone. Your stamina decreases each time you get hit by an inhabitant, and when your stamina is severely depleted, you are returned to the Falcon's Wing and a time period is incurred. The mission ends when your stamina is reduced completely, or when the time limit for the mission has expired.

Description=Fallen Angel is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Double Dragon. You play the fallen angel, sent on a mission to locate the leader of a drug distribution network. Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don't need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.

Description=Football coin-op conversion. Large sprites and small playing field. Passing is not important as the main emphasis is on winning the ball and running with it. Very difficult to keep hold of the ball when you are in possession as the opposition defenders have a lot more pace than the player with the ball so games tend to be a melee in the middle of the field of players all frantically tackling each other for possession.

Description=Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.<br><br>The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.

Description=In the game, you, as commander of the Firefly, must destroy the 'mechanoid system framework' that your enemy has created by destroying its energy source.<br><br>The framework is represented as a grid of squares or sectors.  Ultimately you must reach and destroy the power source, at the far right of the grid, whilst at the start of the game you only have access to the 'dead zone', at the far left of the grid, and those squares immediately adjacent.  This can be extended as described below.<br><br>Planetary sectors are systems with planets in them, and cannot be entered as they are the enemy's main colonies, so are too well defended.  Thus they block the path.<br><br>Unconstructed regions can be taken over, turning them into part of the dead zone, by bypassing the 'instrusion detection' alarm system.  The system involves the cursor flicking between 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' symbols, and you must press fire when 'thumbs up' is displayed to take over the system.  A thumbs down will scramble the squares on the grid.<br><br>The main part of the game takes place when you try to take over an occupied zone.  Here the game is a shoot-em-up, where you can move freely in two dimensions, and shoot at your enemies.  Your ammunition orbits you, and when fired takes a moment to come back to you, so you can temporarily run out of ammo if you fire too quickly.  .<br><br>In an occupied zone there are 4 energy points that you must destroy.  To destroy an energy source you must collect 4 zokas, or excess energy units from it, then enter, and select a thumbs up as  the cursor alternates between it and a thumbs down.  The cursor alternates more quickly in successive energy points.  <br><br>Teleports can be used, to move between areas, but when you attempt to use one, your ship rotates whilst pointing at a set of alternating green and red dots in a circle.  You must hit the fire button 3 times in succession, when the ship is pointing at a green dot, with the ship spinning faster each time. <br><br>If you take too much damage your ship explodes, and you lose a life, and re-enter the grid, with the occupied zone still occupied.  However, if you successfully destroy all 4 energy points, the occupied zone becomes part of the dead zone as you re-enter the grid.

Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.<br><br>This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. <br><br>The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.<br><br>Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

Description=A Flunky is a male servant who must do routine jobs for his masters; in this game you are a Flunky and your masters are the British Royal Family. There are five tasks to be undertaken – light all the fires, fetching a toy boat from the bath for Prince Andrew, some freckles for Fergie, a wig for Diana, and a mystery task for the Queen. To gain access to each room, you need the signatures of particular royals along the way. <br><br>Flunky is an arcade adventure using the same game system as other Don Priestley's Trapdoor license – large sprites overlaid onto block objects, seemingly designed around Spectrum attribute-clash issues. Many screens operate on more than 1 horizontal plane, so you can move your character in and out of the screens as well as across them. Guards will shoot at you if you attempt to access restricted areas, so be careful.

Description=Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.<br><br>The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.

Description=After the success of Football Manager, this was one of the first rival attempts. You can choose any league team to manage, although they always start in the 4th division.<br><br>You will have to hire scouting, physiotherapy and coaching staff before you can do much - you can also hire a youth team for the chance of uncovering a rough diamond. Each week there are up to 2 players available to sign, who are (like your own players) rated out of 10 for form - players with more than 5 will rarely want to play in division 4. Matches are played outside your view, with a minute-by-minute update, and all the other results afterwards.<br><br>Money management is all-important; you can improve your stadium, sell players, take out a loan, and pay for your club's insurance. Injuries and suspensions, as well as cup and eventually European matches, all add to the challenge.

Description=The war with the Kralthans is on, and they've taken prisoners. These people must be rescued from the Draconis caves and the Crystaline caves that are located just outside the Kralthan main command center, Fort Apocalypse. The Fort is too powerful to attack directly, but perhaps a single rocket copter, carefully controlled might be able to do what an army cannot. However the caves are narrow and the enemy has still setup impact shields, defenses and Hyper-Chambers within their depths. <br><br>Fort Apocalypse is a 4-way side-scrolling game, somewhat similar to Choplifter. The player takes the seat of a "rocket copter" and can move up, down, as well as left and right. However this helicopter takes time to turn between left and right perspectives, facing the "front" of the screen. While facing the front, the player is able to drop powerful plasma bombs which can destroy heavy weapons and doors. When facing directly left or right, the weapon used is a more maneuverable but weaker interceptor rocket. Displayed on the screen is a "Navatron", which functions as a radar showing terrain and enemies not yet on the map. Prisoners, once found can be landed on top of them in order to rescue them. There are also "Hyper-Chambers", which are glowing teleporters to other Hyper Chambers located on the same level. Fuel is constantly consumed while flying, but can be recharged at Fuel depots scattered throughout the level. There are also separate Landing Pads which will be the point at which a new helicopter is given to the player, should they be defeated in battle.<br> <br><br>Enemies include laser beams, teleporting rocks, breakable walls, self-propelled mines (SPM), armored tanks (which can only be destroyed from their treads), alien droids and hostile robo-choppers.

Description=This is a platform-game, where you play as a man who's experiencing a horrible nightmare. And if you die in it, you die for real...<br><br>Your mission is to survive long enough to wake up. For every room you visit, another 6 minutes goes by, and at 8:12 the alarm clock will ring, and save your life.<br><br>Your secondary objective is to increase your dream-state. You start with a "bad dream", but by killing monsters, and collecting chalices, you can get much worse dreams, like "horrible dream" or "deadly vision". Your dream-state is displayed in text-form at the top of the screen, and does not affect the game in any other way.<br><br>This is a horror game, and you will face zombies, bats, ghosts, and other terrifying creatures. If they touch you, you lose one of your five lives. You can collect different items, like guns, crucifixes, clocks, and other stuff. Your inventory can hold up to three items at once.<br><br>You can kill some enemies with the gun, but many are immune to it. Crucifixes can freeze enemies, and clocks slows them down.<br><br>The game consists of a huge maze of interconnected rooms. It's easy to get lost, and the game is almost impossible to complete, even if you cheat. So this is for anyone who wants a big challenge.

While avoiding the orbs, the ship can be slowed down by releasing fuel so it makes navigating to the pads easier. The pads each consist of three layers, and a layer is removed when the player's ship lands on it and a small blue alien enters it. Once done, the player needs to guide the alien back to the vessel. The invaders will get released from the orbs, but the player can shoot them with a bullet.

Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too.

Description=In a dangerous world, individual superheroes are not enough. Even the best of them - a humanoid made of flame, an elf princess with a mean bow, and a musclebound waterbeast - can't do it all themselves. When they come together, they are Gamma Force. Can anybody stop them?<br><br>This was one of the first interactive comic books (along with Lane Mastodon and ZorkQuest.)<br><br>The unique element of this software was you could "follow" the narrative from a single character's point of view, or "jump" to another character's.  Thus, you could re-read the story to learn new things about how the character's different paths affected each other and the outcome of the story.<br>The display technology used a 3D vector format; Many scenes scaled (like zooming on a camera lens), although this sacrificed detailed graphical textures and colors.

Description=Gangbusters is a turn-based, text-based Gangster simulator requiring at least two players.  Beginning with the start of prohibition and ending when one player becomes the Godfather (or when the Feds get too wise to the situation), Gangbusters takes the players through the life of crime: extortion, gambling, pay-offs, taking out contracts, serving time, and spending money.  Each player completes their turn (one year gametime) by issuing orders on several screens, deciding how to invest money, and then reading summary reports at the end to see how well you've done.  Random events, like Fed crack downs, could mean you spend some time in jail, dropping big bucks at the racetrack attracts positive and negative attention, stealing limos puts your neck on the line, and hitmen are always one phone call away.

Magic items abound, and help the warrior make it through the caverns.  Some magic items are traps too; there is a healing potion bottle that is similar to a poison bottle.  Other magic items include effects to freeze opponents, turn the warrior invisible, hide him among monsters with an illusion, annihilate all opponents in the current cavern, and cure disease.

The puzzles gradually ramp up in difficulty, and a wide selection of whimsical trophies are awarded.  To prolong gameplay enjoyment and the exploration of the play environment, Robinett's trademark easter eggs are in the eaves, as well as UI manipulation well before its time, allowing players to "skin" the game with different tilesets or manually edit individual tiles.

Description=This must be one of the earliest team sport games to use a first-person view – the packaging mocks the Xs and Os used to represent players in contemporary Gridiron games. What you see is what the player sees – control and viewpoint passes from the kicker to the receiver on a punt or kickoff, and the quarterback to the running back or receiver on a pass or kick. Releasing passes involves rotating the controls to select the pass direction. To take the ball, aim the visible hands in the centre of the screen.<br><br>There are 28 teams split into four divisions; their names are fictional (including the Seagulls, Mustangs and Geronimos), and each is rated out of 3 on 8 areas of skill. Matches last for 4 quarters of either 4 or 7 minutes' in-play time. Menus to select plays or teams involve using diagonal movements for selection. <br><br>Standard Gridiron rules apply – gain 10 yards in 4 attempts (downs) without fumbling or having a pass intercepted; kick a punt or field goal if you are about to fail at this.

Description=Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.<br><br>Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.<br><br>As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.

The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.

Description=Datasoft's The Goonies is one of the most fondly-remembered games in the genre of platform action-adventure-puzzle games for which Datasoft was known (other games included Conan: Hall of Volta, Bruce Lee, and Zorro, all well-regarded classics).<br><br>The game is licensed from the internationally-beloved Steven Speilberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern.  However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.<br><br>The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains unique and creative puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.  For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.<br><br>One of the characteristic elements of this series of games is that it was organized more like an arcade game than an adventure game; the game kept a score and a high score, you got a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there was no save feature.  In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending.  As might be expected, not many people finished these games.  (However, nowadays with emulators and memory-state-saving features, this is no longer such a frustrating problem.)<br><br>The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.

Description=Gordian Tomb is a flip-screen platform/adventure game from Germany. Montezuma's Revenge seems to be a major influence on the overall design. The main protagonist is a relic hunter that must explore a pyramid to find a secret treasure room. He must pick up and use various tools on his way to overcome obstacles and access unreachable areas. Objects are collected by colliding with them. In order to be able to collect an object, the player must first find the screen where it has to be used. Otherwise, the object can't be taken and the game gives a warning in the hint area: "Later dude!". The protagonist has to avoid death by wild animals, dangerous environments and supernatural phenomena. On the top of the screen there is the ever-decreasing timer. Below that is displayed a hint (if available) about the screen, usually describing what object can be used. At the bottom there are several slots for the paraphernalia collected, and below that images of the protagonist as the number of lives.<br><br>The game starts with a 32 minutes time limit and 8 lives, and has no form of saving progress.

The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship & shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;<br><br>The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;<br><br>The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;<br><br>The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.<br><br>Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.

When this happens you can run to his end to win. The main things to avoid during the match are being hit by a shot and kicking one into the crowd. When hit you lose time recovering, and are penalised with a Pelvan, which can cost you up to 3 Beloms, by hitting the crowd.<br><br>After every third match you must play the Faulton Feeding game, which involves aiming at six progressively-higher poles to hit the Faulton creature with the food - fail to get enough of these and you must replay the previous match.

Those were rough times, lads. Rough times. Been shot down in my plane. Darn shame it was, it being a good plane and all. Next I know, there’s this group of German soldiers standing round me, and off we go to a P.O.W. camp. Big thing, that, plenty of guards all around with a keen eye on your every move, and full of unfortunate souls like myself. Just that they do naught but sit all day and sob and generally be no great help when it comes to doing the Great Escape. But not me, no sir! I showed them Germans, I did, and I was out of their fashionable high security “he who comes here, stays here” camp in no time. You wanna hear that story? Bet you do!<br><br>Controlling a prisoner of war in a German camp, your goal is to break out undetected. There are numerous ways to freedom – back doors, cracked fences, even underground tunnels. However, you have to plan your escape while obeying the strict rules of the camp. <br><br>Number one: Daily program. You have to attend two roll calls a day, one meal, one exercise, and stay in bed at night. Failure to appear at any of these events will result in the alarm being rung. When you do not touch the controls, your protagonist will move automatically, going to all important events. You have to detect and use gaps in the time-table to explore the camp. <br><br>Rule number two: guard rooms are off limits. If a soldier catches you in a room that is forbidden, you will be placed in solitary confinement. Of course, you have to enter restricted parts of the camp to find items crucial for your escape. The moral flag will turn from green to red to indicate that you are in an area where you shouldn’t be. <br><br>Rule no three: no prisoner may carry forbidden objects. When you are caught in a suspicious situation, you will be stripped of all items that you found so far. To avoid that, you have to deposit objects in a safe place. You need to find keys to open locked doors, uniforms for camouflage, flashlights to see in dark tunnels, and many more. <br><br>Rule number four: guard commands are to be obeyed at all times. The German soldiers patrol on fixed routes and have a line of sight. You have to learn the guard’s routes and sneak past their backs to avoid detection when breaking out. If you are caught, your morale will decrease. If your morale reaches zero, your will to escape is broken.

Description=Gremlins is an action game based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. The game takes place just after midnight when there are Gremlins and Mogwai running around Billy's living room!<br><br>You control Billy from a 3rd person point of view. On each level, your goal is to catch all of the Mogwai and return them to their cage (located in the upper right corner of the screen) and to destroy all of the Gremlins with a sword. Each level has a time limit - at 6:00 am when the sun rises. You move on to the next level by completing your tasks or just surviving until 6:00, although more points are awarded for the former. You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage. <br><br>On many of the levels there will be various types of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may also be  puddles of water; if a Gremlin or Mogwai runs into the water, it will split into two. Some levels also contain a refrigerator or popcorn machine which will throw food out onto the screen, or a television which will distract the Gremlins. <br><br>You also begin the game with a limited number of flash cubes; if you get into trouble, you can use these to temporarily stun all of the Gremlins and Mogwai. As the levels progress gameplay becomes faster and the Gremlins and Mogwai more numerous.

Players take the role of Billy, who has already been tricked into feeding Gizmo after midnight, and now Kingston Falls is in danger of being overrun with Gremlins.  With Gizmo's help, Billy must save the town before it is too late.<br><br>There are some animated graphics in this one.  The game has less than 50 locations, though time is a factor - the gremlins home in on Billy with every move he makes, so there is no chance to dawdle. The design means that deaths are more frequent than in most adventures. It uses the same parser as the other Adventure International games of this era.

It is split into sixteen levels - apart from the first and last, these are played in a random order each time. Gribbly can blow bubbles, as a weapon.<br><br>Levels are comprised of a giant Energy Web of diagonally-linked protective beams, parts of which can be disabled using switches. The web is to shield you from Seon, a rogue Blabgorian who uses his powers as a negative force. When there is only one Gribblet left, the barriers are released and Seon is free to chase you down.<br><br>There are two initial types of active foes - seed pods (which move) and Chrysalis (which don't). Both hurt you on contact but are destroyed by bubbles. However, if Seed pods hit the ground they transform into Topsies (which can flip the Gribblets onto their backs, making them vulnerable), and if Crysalis are not destroyed quickly enough they turn into Stompers (which are indestructible and can kill Gribblets, but die on contact with water and are not intelligent to avoid it). When a Stomper kills a Gribblet, it becomes a Flier, which can re-release Gribblets - forcing you to quickly grab them.

Description=Habitat is a MMO (massive multiplayer online game), originally designed by Chip Morningstar and Noah Falstein at Lucasfilm Games. Although it is not the first online game, it lay the groundwork for modern MMORPGs by allowing more than 20,000 gamers to play in the same open-ended, virtual world, even though it doesn't contain typical RPG characteristics such as levelling, skills, abilities and classes. Still, Habitat forms the link between text-based MUDs that rarely topped the 100-player mark and modern MMORPGs. Because of the limited trial phase it was released in, it never contained more than 500 players.<br><br>The game was originally released as a beta test and could only be played through Quantum Link, an online service of Quantum Computer Services (which later became America OnLine), and was only available in the evenings and weekends, as network traffic was cheaper at those moments. You control an avatar, seen from a third-person perspective in a 2D world. Avatars can gesture, move around, communicate with other characters, and manipulate objects. The world consists of thousands of regions - different environments that can be accessed through doors, teleportation and other entrances. You can also communicate through the in-game mail system or by using ESP (telepathic abilities), and personalise your avatar with the skin tone, features, or clothing.<br><br>Players can visit stores, houses, pubs, forests... and use objects such as tools, weapons and magical items. The stress is on the social dimension. You can get married, play games, write a book, go adventuring, visit theatres or lectures, or start a company, a guild, or a religion. Each player has a bank account and there is an in-game economy based on tokens. The game designers even appeared in the game as powerful opponents and global quests were organised. These are presented as one-time challenges, and not as instances multiple players can encounter at different moments. Players can also turn into ghosts to discover new areas without risks. Although there are no real classes, people can behave as thieves, law enforcers or clergymen. There are no regulations and players are only limited to what the game code allows. Quests are provided by the Oracle, an almighty entity that 'created' the Habitat. The libertarian approach with the freedom in gameplay was introduced because people solved quests too quickly and the developers would never be able to keep up with new content.<br><br>New features were added gradually. Rather than controlling or limiting the possibilities, the developers observed gamers' behaviour and introduced novelties according to the needs. It also includes PvP fighting (player vs. player) and safe zones in the cities. Habitat has its own newspaper, The Rant, documenting events and reserved for announcements.<br><br>The project was ended in 1988 when Quantum Link observed that the 500 players played the game so much that the game's traffic ate up 1% of the total capacity of the entire QL service. The company feared it would not be able to sustain the network with a full release open to many more players, and scrapped the project. It resurfaced later in 1988 as Club Caribe, and as Fujitsu Habitat in 1990 when the technology was licensed to Fujitsu. Eventually, Fujitsu bought it entirely and launched it as WorldsAway in 1995. The game currently lives on as Vzones and the fantasy variant Second Kingdom. Right now, the unrelated Second Life incorporates most of Habitat's mechanics.

Description=Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.<br><br>Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...

Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again,  involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.<br><br>In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.

Description=The military is often painted in terms of precision.  Orders are expected to be followed exactly.  But what happens when those giving the orders are blind?  Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information.  This game puts the player in the shoes of a Corps commander—a man responsible for several divisions—for the lives of thousands of men.  The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader.<br><br>In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.<br><br>Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine.  Out in the field, their duty is to carry out orders to the best of their ability.  They must try to cope with the unexpected that interferes with their progress—weather, enemies, terrain, fatigue, lack of supplies... Unfortunately, it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the command centers. Commanders don't have a personal connection to each person under them.  They rely on those underneath them to report in...<br><br>This game gives some insight to the problems of command.  There are hundreds of units to keep track of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized.  The units become symbols on a map-board.  Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player sends out.  Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control.  Will they be able or willing to follow orders exactly?  What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by weather, by terrain.  Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a division (thousands of men) to their deaths?<br><br>Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command centers, where the orders that they must follow come from.  This game recreates the command center.

A long hallway with seven doorways in it at the start offers the player the opportunity to enter dungeon areas of varying difficulty (easiest and more open at the top, hardest at the bottom). In these areas of the tower, the player can explore, finding treasure and elixir bottles (which can be used to replenish the player's magic). Of course, things aren't that simple. The Things roam the various corridors and will chase and attack the player on sight, even going so far as to disguise themselves as ordinary objects until the player comes in range.

Though this king is best known historically for his codification of laws and edicts, composed and engraved in cuneiform tablets ~1780 BC, the game veers away from lawmaking and the pursuit of justice in favour of guiding your population of subjects to stable, contented growth.  The game puts it, somewhat blandly, in other words:<br><br>YOUR TASK IS TO DEVELOP A STABLE ECONOMY BY THE WISE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR RESOURCES. YOU WILL BE BESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY NATURAL EVENTS.<br>Results of your actions are narrated to you in plain text; player input primarily consists of punching in numbers and selecting the occasional YES and NO (the end of every turn typically asking you DO YOU WISH TO ABDICATE?) into your keyboard, touchscreen -- or TeleType terminal.  Gameplay and interaction are restrictive, but the minimalist number-crunching is foundational for all the managerial leadership games that followed: You can buy and sell acres of land, purchasing extra bushels of grain to sow in your fields or feed your populace if so needed.  Between turns (only 10 on the iPhone version), citizens starve and are laid low by plagues, peasants immigrate to replace them, and vermin deplete your stores of grain reserves.  One year is much the same as the next, though the particular numerical values shift according to elegant algorithms the deeper understanding of which will lead you to a fruitful and harmonious reign, concluding with enthusiastic congratulations from the computer:<br><br>A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE!!! CHARLEMAGNE, DISRAELI, AND JEFFERSON COMBINED COULD NOT HAVE DONE BETTER!

As a result, all of the people are forced to go in a Life Suspension Program, except Hawk, who must recover all thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive.<br><br>The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but Hawk can collect up to three different weapons – shields, mines, and stryders – that can be used against them. Also scattered around are various hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and gun turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some energy if he collides into them. There are several objects which Hawk can use to his advantage. Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be used to reach higher platforms, and teleports can take him to different areas.

Description=Ned is trapped inside the human Head, and his job is to wait for the nerve centers to indicate when an impulse is ready. When one is, he has to collect the impulse and carry it to the brain. If an impulse originates from the brain, Ned must carry it to the neck. <br><br>There are two types of enemies Ned must watch out for. The throbs, which appear in various disguises, spill down from the brain and run around the head, and they can be avoided or atomized. Occasionally, Head Banger appears from the neck and makes his way up to the brain, and he must be stopped at all costs to avoid a major headache. If Ned survives long enough, he will return to a clear Head.

Description=An early American Football strategy game from the same stable as Kevin Tom's pioneering Football Manager, which gives the player the role of Head Coach of an NFL American Football team and the responsibility of building up the squad by trading players and draft picks, selecting the offense, defence and kicker and calling the plays each week during the regular season games. Games are played out with simple graphics depicting rush, line plunge and pass plays as well as field goal attempts. Successful teams advance to the playoffs and possibly to the Super Bowl. An unusual feature is the College Draft in which draft picks were used to select new players for the next season. The master "Head Coach" would aim to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons on the highest level of the game.

But the increasing amount of industry has resulted in high levels of pollution, damaging the plants and killing off the forests.<br><br>To deal with the forthcoming doom, the Gnostics constructed the Leg, a heat probe that has the capability of entering polluted areas, absorbing the heat of the Zeal smog flames, and giving that heat to the three plants. It can hop up plants and walls, and slide along the floor for faster movement. To defend itself from dangers – which include wildlife and acid rain - the Leg can shoot the Ball which it carries, or use a smart bomb if the going gets tough. Contact with any danger loses the Leg energy. Chalk can be collected which protects it from the acid rain.<br><br>The Ball can also be thrown out to collect heat, which must be stored in the Leg so that it can be given to the three Triphylios plants. If it has stored enough energy, the plants open petals to block the acid rain.<br><br>When the Ball has absorbed heat and it is returned to the Leg, the Leg gains energy and the pass counter gets boosted. When this counter reaches 9999, the Leg can teleport itself to the next jungle level where it is able to seek out more Zeal flames in order to save the Triphylios.

Description=Six different track and field disciplines are recreated in this multi-event sports simulation. Up to six human players can take them on.You can replay each attempt, or watch simulated recording of the world record distances and speeds of the day, for training purposes.<br><br>100m sprint and 110m hurdles have a similar joystick waggling technique, but time the jumps over the hurdles accurately. The long jump is also waggling-based, with the joystick being pushed up to launch the jump and ensure a correct landing. <br><br>In diving you can choose the jump to attempt, with more difficult ones worth more points if you get it right. In archery you shoot at four circles of differing distances several times, aiming to get as close to the centre as possible. This is done by holding down fire to prepare the arrow, and push down to release the bow. Weightlifting involves the snatch and clean-and-jerk phases, with the latter involving more joystick presses to keep the weights under control.

Description=The game is a computer adaptation of an American TV game show, where two competitors should win a game and money, throwing dices, eliminating certain numbers and answering trivial questions.<br><br>The gameplay flows in real-time mode. For each roll of the dice a question must be answered. The first player should  press his/her keys to have a chance to answer the question. If the first player to hit their key answers correctly, then he or she have control of the dice and may decide whether to roll them or pass them to the other player. If however the first player to answer answers incorrectly, then the other player has control of the dice and may roll or pass.<br><br>In the one player game, you compete against the computer. In novice mode the computer plays less intelligently than in expert mode and responds incorrectly to questions more often.  The two player game follows the same format as one player game, but with both human opponents playing at hot-seat.<br><br>The object of the game is to clear the columns of numbers thus winning the money total at the bottom of the column (if you win the game). In order to take numbers off the board you must answer a question correctly or be passed the dice. You roll the dice trying not to roll a total that doesn't equal some of the remaining numbers on the board. For example if there are only three numbers left on the board it is probably a good idea to pass the dice since there are quite a few illegal rolls. For every Doubles you roll, you get an insurance marker which allows you to roll illegally without losing the game (but only once). You can take off 1,2,3 or 4 numbers from the board at one time.<br><br>Winning the competition, Bonus Round will be proposed to a player. Its idea is to clear all of the numbers off of the board, without rolling an illegal combination (without an insurance marker). If a player achieves the goal, he/she get an additional $10,000! After a player completes the bonus round he/she become the current champion and subsequent players must play him/her until they defeat him/her. But the current champion does not appear in the High Rollers Champions file until he/she loses.<br><br>Hi-scores are written in Top Ten Table.

However the treasury is fairly empty and in order to make his dream come true, the Kramden's and their friends, the Norton's will need to work extra hard and be a little lucky to reach the required amount. But Miami Beach is a popular destination, and the families must hurry before all the hotels are booked.<br><br>The Honeymooners is really 4 different mini-games for one to four players who compete against one another. The goal is represented by a train car heading towards Miami Beach. The goal is to earn enough points (presumably representing money) to move the train car all the way there. In order to gain points, the player attempts to complete one of the following mini-games:<br><br>1. No If's, And's or Bus: Ralph Kramden is a bus driver and must pick up as many passengers and take them to their destinations. The game is played as an overhead view over a map of steet names and passangers. The goal is to pick up waiting passangers and deliver them to the destination they want. The player only controls the bus's direction (up, down, left, right) and speed. Delivering passengers earns points but leaving passengers on the bus will lose points. Hitting other traffic or returning to the bus depot will end the game.<br>2. Sewer I Do: Ed Norton works for the sewer company and has a map of the tunnels' layout. However his map has blown away so he must navigate the sewers from memory, fixing leaks and eventually returning to his ladder. The game is played in first-person 3D maze with the player being able to move forward, back and rotate left and right.<br>3. Going to Pieces: Alice Kramden works at a department store and is talking to Trixie when she drops a jig-saw puzzle. The player must reassemble the image before time runs out.<br>4. Additionally, "The $99,000 Answer" is Ralph's favorite game show, sometimes appears at the end of mini-games as a double-or-nothing bonus round. Players must answer trivia questions related to The Honeymooners TV show. However game shows are all about luck and sometimes the player will win or lose randomly without a question being asked.

Description=The player controls four bouncing balls that must make their way through twelve environments ranging from park to desert and beach to undersea world, collecting up to ten balloons in each. Each one of the balls must deal with several hazards, by jumping over them or crushing them. Collision with any of these will cause a ball to burst. <br><br>The player can speed up or slow down the balls, or control their height, to make it easy to avoid these hazards. If all four balls have been punctured, the player loses a life. Once all ten balloons have been collected, the player is transported to the next environment, and when they have managed to get through all twelve environments, the player is transported back to the first environment.

The road is full of cars and bikes, contact with each of which costs $10 in ambulance fees out of your starting $40, and the skis themselves cost $10.<br><br>The actual skiing section has a pseudo-3D view, similar to a roving camera mounted above the course. Your task is to cut between the red and blue sets of flags, without hitting any of the trees on the course. Light contact with these will allow you to carry on; heavy contact breaks your skis and sends you back to the first section of the game (which you also return to after completing each of the courses).

Description=Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced.<br><br>Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race.<br><br>Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.

Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!

Description=The Games of the XXIII Olympiad were held in Los Angeles in 1984 and for the first time since the advent of the video game industry, this king of sporting competitions was to be held in a first-world nation.  In simpler times, this might have inspired people to head out to a track or gymnasium to try their stuff, but now for the first time an industry was poised to let the hands of the middle-class masses do all the work virtually, through joysticks, needing no facilities or specialised equipment (beyond a video game console) to try the whole gamut of events.<br><br>Since numerous companies realised this around the same time, from a marketing perspective, the only serious question is: what's going to make your Olympiad game stand out from the rest?  Will you have an expensive celebrity endorsement by a Gold medal-winner?  Will you implement the flags and national anthems of all participating countries?  Perhaps you've been beaten to the punch.  Well, here's a tack no one has considered yet -- have the player control the Hunchback of Notre Dame, as he shambles faster, higher and stronger toward Olympic gold!  He's an established hero of video games plus his public domain status makes him cheaper to use than, say, Sam the Eagle, the mascot of the 1984 Summer Games.<br><br>I don't know what elapsed at that board meeting, but the pitch was green-lighted, and so we ended up with a game in which our unlikely hero Quasimodo is guided, through dedicated joystick-wiggling, through the 100m sprint, long jump, shot put, discus throw, javelin throw, 110m hurdles and high jump, all in hopes to impress Esmeralda, the object of his affection.  It's a far cry from the belfries and gargoyles of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, but perhaps the change of scenery will do him some good.

Gathering all the bells permits you to advance higher up the tower, at the top of which the damsel in distress awaits your homely visage.

Instead, you navigate sites in, around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a life at the merest contact.<br><br>The narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually visually indicated above a baroque text input/output field.  The interface is as intuitive as those of the prior games in the franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their respective styles of gameplay.  Now you can give your twitchy fingers a rest and let your brain take over for a while.

Description=Hypaball is a two player futuristic sports game, played between the Hawks (human) and the Vipers (human or CPU). Choose your three-man team from a pool of 10 players, each with slightly different stats for strength, agility and speed. <br><br>The teams have to pass and catch a ball and shoot it to a moving basket in the middle of the screen. Two players are in the air (one in each half of the arena), while the third remains on the ground to collect an otherwise-dead ball. You simultaneously control the grounder and the air player nearer the ball - they move left and right in unison, but only the air player responds to up-down movements. Players can only hold possession for 2.5 seconds, in order to keep the games fast and frantic.

Description=Hyperbowl is a one-on-one futuristic sport viewed from above, with a small amount of the rectangular pitch visible at a time.  Each player controls one of the 10 available spaceships, each with their own subtle strengths and weaknesses in terms of speed, inertia and fire direction. A scanner shows the positions of both ships and the ball, so that things don't become disorientating.<br><br>The aim is to guide the ball either into a 'goal' in the middle of each end (scoring 2 points) or onto the goal-line elsewhere (scoring one point). The ball can be steered either by hitting it with the ship or by shooting at it with your craft's beam (which does not injure or impede the opposition craft in any way). In either case the ball moves in a semi-random direction similar to the one you directed it in, but can rebound off the plus-shaped divots in the wall unexpectedly.<br><br>The game lasts for 5 minutes, or until a player reaches the winning score of 9. Each of the three skills levels is a 5-tier tournament of increasing difficulty.

Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

This is repeated until the over is complete.<br><br>Batting : In a single player game the computer will start as the batting team. <br>When the player is batting they must select where they wish to hit the ball that's just been bowled. This is done by holding down the 'Fire' key while pressing the numeric keys to select a direction. Directions can be changed at will right up until the time the 'Fire' key is released. The ball should be struck at the last possible moment for<br>maximum strength.<br><br>Fielding : Once the ball has been batted the player has the chance to select a fielder to chase the ball to try to prevent it reaching the boundary. If the ball touches the running fielder or any of the stationary fielders, it is either caught or thrown at the wicket to attempt to run the batsman out. Fielders may be repositioned at the start of each over. Dismissal appeals for, say leg-before-wicket (LBW), is not automatic as appeals may be rejected by the umpire.

It did not feature tactical space battles, however.<br><br>The main game screen displayed a grid of dots, with star systems shown by a larger circle with a color representing the star's type. Stars could have zero, one, or two inhabitable planets. Warships could be custom designed and were tracked individually with a maximum of 255 war ships per player in existence at one time. Transports could carry either colonists and troops and traders carried metal or food surpluses to where they were needed. During an invasion, the respective armies from each player would fight until one force was destroyed. However, planets thus captured could suffer from guerrilla resistance for several turns and if not eradicated could overthrow the invaders or assist your opponent's armies in the event of a counter invasion.<br><br>Given the tiny systems it ran on, this game did a very good job of simulating many important considerations, and was the first introduction of some of the things that have become staples in 4X space games; most notably ship design and refits.

Description=Strategy games with a real-time movement element didn't begin with Dune 2, and this was one early implementation of the concept. Your army has landed on an alien planet and has the intention of destroying their weather control station, and ideally as many of their units as possible.<br><br>The action is viewed from above, and you use a cursor to direct units, and automatically target and attack enemy units. Once you blow up the weather control tower, by exploding at least 2 bombs next to it, you must flee the planet ASAP. Protecting all your units is important and requires a tactical overview approach, but the bombs are particularly vital.

Description=Big Business, stripped down to the bare essentials: Make lots of money in this turn-based management simulation by buying companies and selling the goods they produce. Invest is all about, well, investment - fresh cash flows directly into new businesses, new shares and new company improvements in a never-ending cycle of productivity.<br><br>Up to four human players can compete for market dominance; the computer takes vacant places. Whoever amasses the most money or builds a monopoly in one of the six business areas (from pharmaceuticals to space engineering) wins. Tension rises as hired saboteurs and spies infiltrate companies to cause maximum damage - unless they are caught by a detective on guard. <br><br>Invest is a German game and was never published in any other language.

You are in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of magical Baghdad and become "Caliph instead of the Caliph!"  To accomplish this aim, you must wander around and interact with characters around you, acquiring objects along the way that may or may not be useful, and figure out how all this will help you achieve your goal.<br><br>During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum.  Depending on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether.  You will need objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters.  Some characters are helpful, others are not.  But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace.  Just be careful not to lose your own head in the process!

In each geographic area you will have different problems, interlaced within a series of "custom pictures" which gather part of Europe and North  Africa as they were in the first century BC. It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart. In this history you will assume the role of this fabulous personage. <br><br>But it won't be easy: instead of living one of his moments of greatness, you will incarnate a defeated Jabato, without friends, prisoner in a dirty Roman jail with the bitter feeling that his beloved Claudia is captive in a distant land. Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you survive, you will fight the final battle against the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.

But instead of a net, we will have to play with a wall, using it as our "third player".

There are eight regions that Jim can explore, and in these regions, it is Jim's task to dig holes and obtain any items that he finds. Whatever items that he finds will be stored in his inventory, but he can carry up to eight items at a given time. While Jim is busy digging into the squares, the volcano continues to land on squares, and when Jim has dug through the square already, the resulting fireball to restore the square to its former glory. Jim also has to watch out for Flesh-Eater, an insect that hops around the screen undoing Jim's handiwork, and the only way to destroy him is for Jim to obtain an axe and hunt him down. <br><br>Jim has a limited number of digs, and if he runs out, he jumps into a warp hole scattered around the island, and into a pit infested by snakes. Jim needs to avoid them while getting the flashing squares that will increase his digs. If Jim gets poisoned by a snake too many times, he will lose a life. Once Jim has gained enough digs, another warp hole will appear that will transport Jim back onto the surface.<br><br>Some items help Jim deal with any dangers that appear, but if Jim happens to find a ladder, the volcano will turn into a series of steps which Jim can leave the region by. But at the same time, a nasty thief will appear and appears to hunt Jim down. If the thief manages to reach Jim, items that Jim obtained will be stolen one by one. If Jim leaves the region before the thief can get to him, he is taken to the shop.<br><br>Here, Jim can trade his items for a number of tokens, and get something else on display. Some items are worth more than others, and if Jim hasn't got enough tokens, he is unable to trade and needs to go to a different region in order to drop some items that are of small value so that he can have the opportunity again. The main goal is for Jim to empty out the display so that he can build a device that will allow him to escape the island.

There are also timing-based hazards such as arrows emerging from walls and lazer beams - contact with any of these costs one of your five lives. You also lose a life if you run out of energy.

Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.<br><br>There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.

The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.

Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and  taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. <br><br>To do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time.<br><br>Besides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.

Description=The Zyroneans were an advanced, pacifistic civilization until the arrival of the tyrant Kayleth. Sending down armies of androids from his space ship, he enslaved the planet Zyron and forced its inhabitants to work in mines and gather Chromazin, a rare mineral, for him. You are a Zyronean who has made a plan to free the planet from Kayleth' reign. However, as the game begins, you find yourself trapped in an unknown place with no memory of the events that led you to this situation. In order to find out where you are, what happened to you and ultimately save your home planet, you will have to interact with several (android) characters, solve various puzzles and survive encounters with ferocious creatures.

Description=By 1989 Kenny Dalglish scarcely played for Liverpool, and was almost entirely concentrating on his role as manager, so a football management game with no arcade action featuring his license made sense. The game is purely icon- and menu-driven, perhaps the first step in dragging the genre into the 90s. Whichever team you took charge of start from the 4th division. Match highlights can be selected - these are viewed from the side and show goals and near-misses, although they can be turned off.<br><br>You start with squads of over 20 players from which to choose your team of 11, each given a straightforward ability rating. Formations can be selected by placing each player in a precise position alongside the formation of the opposition team, using a fairly advanced system for the time. Via a separate menu you can consult with the chairman (to see if he's happy with your efforts), the physio (to check for injuries), the scout (who comes up with players you might like to purchase) and so on.

Description=Kenny Dalglish was a hugely successful player for Celtic, Liverpool and Scotland, before becoming the first person to win the English league championship while both playing and managing (for Liverpool in 1985, also winning the FA Cup that year). This was his second licensed game, and is a side-scrolling action game featuring single matches played between a team in red and a team in blue, each of which can be any of 9 skill levels. Matches can be varied between 10 and 90 minutes. The ball is loosely controlled in a manner similar to the Kick off series, although it isn’t possible to pass the ball a short distance, so an element of hitting and hoping comes into play, especially as the ball can’t be curved far. The ball bounces quite heavily, and is very difficult to shoot on target from closer than 30 yards or so.

The five biggest mystery writers in the world have gathered together at a hotel and one of them will be offing another unless Hercule Holmes can crack the case.  <br><br>Gameplay is a cross between the board-game Clue and the paper-based logic puzzles in which the player must eliminate clues in sequence. To solve the forthcoming murder, you will have to search the suspects' rooms and confront them with the evidence and set the hotel's security cameras to record secret meetings. <br><br>By questioning the suspects as to what they know about certain people, rooms and objects, they may reveal combinations they know will not be involved in the murder - perhaps if it involves the gun, the killer will not be Lord Peter Flimsey, for example.  However, there's a catch. If he accuses the wrong suspect, he might be the one who's Killed Until Dead - they don't take kindly to false accusation.

Description=By 2133, crime is so out-of-control that a more advanced solution than prison is required - offenders have their minds and bodies reprogrammed to turn them into constructive and subservient citizens. As one of the few to refuse such treatment, you escape, and must find your way to freedom, through the six areas of the city, and ultimately through the city walls.<br><br>You have a limited amount of time to finally escape from the city, as it is set to self-destruct. Enemies to take on with your punches and kicks include the guards and five other Re-Formed people. You must find enough food and water to sustain you as you go, as well as keys to escape and bonus items (often hidden) such as extra energy and points bonuses.

Description=In the mid-'70s, an unusual phenomenon took place: two Americans, Willie Crowther and Don Woods wrote the first text adventure game: it was the Original Adventure and was written in Fortran for a DEC PDP-10 and occupied more than 300 K of memory. It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first "martyrs"; several important programmers were fired after becoming "addicted" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.<br><br>In the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called "La Aventura Original" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.<br><br>This version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, "ñ"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form. The characters also use the PSI system, so they are not mere objects with human names, but will listen to you and respond -- but most importantly, will act according to how you treat them.

Wave upon wave of nasties come into the zone, and must be shot down before they reach either wall, where neither gun can reach them and they advance toward you. You can try to escape perpetually, since your movements wrap around the screen borders, at least until another enemy has reached your wall, but it is better to use up one of your electro bolts that will erase everything on the screen.

This is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of screen space to see where you're driving; two thirds of the screen is dedicated to instruments (speed readout, radiation level and mission objectives). The steering method is not the usual Sprint one; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.<br><br>All versions except the C128 version have two levels.

Description=Lethal Zone is a German horizontal shooter in the same vein as the R-Type series of games. You control a spaceship and you shoot enemy ships and obstacles, while avoiding projectiles and crashing on any surface. Holding the fire button and releasing it increases the power of your shots, while hitting it repeatedly lets out a stream of them. The destroyed enemies occasionally leave behind power-ups that can be collected. They increase and modify the power of your shots. You start with 5 lives, and at each 50.000 points you receive an extra one. The games has four levels, each with a unique "boss" enemy at the end.

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.<br><br>Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.<br><br>Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. <br><br>Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.<br><br>The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

Description=The follow-up to the original Lords of Midnight game uses a similar game system to its predecessor, but the story is now much more complex. Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.<br><br>The game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.<br><br>The characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).<br><br>There are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.

Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 points.<br><br>Your score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker. You'll lose 100 points for killing a lady walking down the footpath.

Description=This game, part of the Classic Adventure Series, has the adventuresome player searching for Queen Anne's crown, which was lost in the eighteenth century and last seen in the Arabian desert.  Although entirely text-based, the game takes a somewhat visual approach to interactive fiction.  The screen is split into several boxes: an area description (which specifies visible exits), an inventory, a list of visible items, an auto-map and a list of verbs.  Several statistics are tracked at the bottom of the screen: score, moves, hunger, thirst and number of treasures found (out of 12).  Replay value is enhanced by the fact that certain elements of the game are randomized.

Description=Mafia is set in the Chicago of the 20s and casts you as a small time criminal who has to become "boss of the underworld". Starting out with smaller crimes like robberies and smuggling alcohol, you gain points and eventually higher ranks. Gaining higher ranks means more respect from other criminals and potential victims, which in turn means that more lucrative crimes become available. Shopkeepers are more easily intimidated and therefor more easily robbed or blackmailed. You are also more likely to receive hints about upcoming crimes. After a certain rank has been reached, it is also possible to recruit up to ten gang members which gives you a much better chance in combat against the police or other criminals.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, your character is created by randomly determining various statistics: <br>Energy: the character's health, Strength: determines how fast energy is recovered, Intelligence: influences the odds of success of various crimes, brutality: determines what kind of weapon a character can use.<br><br>The game is turn-based. One turn takes one month and at every turn you can take a certain amount of steps, depending on your method of transportation. Most of the game is spent walking around the town entering buildings where actions can be chosen from various multiple choice menus:<br><br>Stores:<br>Try to blackmail or rob the store. The lower your rank, the higher the chance that the owner calls the police. If you try to blackmail someone who is already "protected" by another gangster, his gang might attack you.<br><br>Bars:<br>Buy or sell alcohol, recruit gang members, get hints about upcoming crimes, get a job as a croupier, bouncer or assassin.<br><br>Weapon Stores:<br>Buy weapons, train gang members (increase intelligence or brutality)<br><br>Car Dealers:<br>Buy or steal a car. Trying to steal a car is risky, but may be rewarded with especially fast cars that cannot be bought.<br><br>Banks:<br>Rob a bank (this requires another gang-member), sneak into the bank and break into the safe (breaking into a safe starts a mini-game).<br><br>"Blüten-Eddie":<br>Buy false money (Blüten) or get a fake ID, which decreases the chances of getting busted during police checks. <br><br>Underground Stations:<br>Pickpocket people at the station or inside the subway car.<br><br>Train-stations:<br>Pickpocket people or try to rob the train.<br><br>Casinos:<br>Play Black Jack, Poker or Roulette. You cannot actually play these games, you simply receive the results, which are influenced by your intelligence.<br><br>Loan Shark:<br>Lend money or start your own loan shark business.<br><br>Police Station:<br>Turn yourself in, bust out another criminal for a reward (only in multiplayer mode) or bribe the chief of police to avoid prosecution.<br><br>When fighting the police, other gangs or trying to assassinate somebody, the game enters combat mode. Combat is turn-based and seen from a top-down perspective. During each turn you can either move your character(s) by one field or attack. Winning a fight increases your points, however, losing a fight doesn't mean the game is over. Losing against other criminals simply means that you won't gain any money. After losing to the police you can still try to escape or bribe the police. When you do go to jail, you lose precious time and points.<br><br>Mafia can be played by up to four players. When it is played by more than one player, a "gang war" option becomes available.

Description=Magnetron was a follow-up to Quazatron.<br><br>Robot KLP-2 returned to destroy a series of space stations around the planet Quartech. This was achieved by overloading or shutting down the four nuclear reactors in each station. KLP-2 had to carry nuclear fuel rods between the reactors, with each rod having a positive or negative charge and a weight. The more weight being carried, the slower KLP-2 moved and the harder it was to get up slopes. The charge affected how the robot reacted to arrow tiles on the floor - a positive charge would move the robot in the direction of the arrow, a negative charge in the opposite direction.<br><br>Throughout the space station were computer screens to give information, in a very similar method to Paradroid. Enemies came in various types and had different weapons, with each showing a rank and droid number on the front. By standing still and holding down fire, KLP-2 entered grapple mode. Now he could run into an enemy and try to take control. This gave a 9x9 grid of symbols. Rearranging the bottom row disarmed the detonator and allowed KLP-2 to steal energy for a recharge. Rearranging all three rows allowed KLP-2 to take over the other robot and use its abilities and weapons.<br><br>Once at the reactor, KLP-2 could add or remove a rod at a time. The aim was either to overload (by getting a big positive number) or shut down (by getting a big negative number). With all four reactors shut down, the lights dimmed and KLP-2 went to a beam pad to move on to the next station.

The host gathers a great amount of fictional facts and clues, and hands it to the players/actors in turns.

The winner is he who gets the most facts right, or, in case no one can guess right, the murderer wins.<br><br>The software is the ultimate tool for the murder party host. You simply input a large amount of data from the guests of your future party, and it automatically mixes their data with the story and generates a murder, motives and a large amount of clues, all to be printed into personal booklets for each player. It even generates the invitations to be mailed to the guests. It also provides a good share of hints on how to host a better murder party, with advice ranging from mood setting, music and costumes to even handing out recipes for three-course dinners. Once the booklets have been printed out, though, the computer is no longer necessary, and it's all up to the host and guests to make the party happen.<br><br>It features two built in scenarios, Empire and Big Kill, each with different stories, characters and settings. And with each time the murderer and motives being generated at random, it makes for a good deal of parties to take place. Up to 8 players can join the fun.

Each square also bears one of five icons, and the color of each square indicates the number of invaders present in each wave. A flashing square is located in the bottom-right of the grid, and this indicates the wave that you will enter. Two pointers are also found outside the grid, and by using these pointers, players can rearrange the rows and columns of this matrix to choose different waves. <br><br>As the players advance through the waves, the invaders will populate over time, whether or not they are playing that wave. To assist them, they have a limited supply of anti-genesis and retro-genesis devices, which are placed on individual squares and doing this will halt and reverse the population explosion. Players need to quickly do this since they have limited time to place the devices and select a wave. The game is over once time runs out.<br><br>If there is an excessive wave population, or the player completes a wave, a "nogo" icon appears in that square. If the player happens to move one of these icons inside the flashing square, they are docked a point from their "nogo" rating. If they do this too many times, the current game ends.

Description=MASK is game based on a popular animated TV series of the mid 1980's. In addition to the TV series, entitled M.A.S.K., an acronymn for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, there was also a series of books, authored by Kenneth Harper and illustrated by Bruce Hogarth, and comics. A new line of toys was produced to accompany each TV series.<br><br>The stories all centre around the M.A.S.K. organisation led by the fearless Matt Tracker. M.A.S.K. agents wear helmets or masks to protect their identities and to give them super powers which help in their fight against the criminal V.E.N.O.M. organisation. They drive super powered vehicles which can transform.<br>V.E.N.O.M., aka the Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem, are the bad guys. They are by Miles Mayhem one time friend of Matt and co-founder of MASK who betrayed Matt long ago. <br><br>There are four areas to the game and in all Matt must drive his Thunderhawk vehicle around the game area, avoiding V.E.N.O.M.'s armoured vehicles and tanks while accomplishing tasks in a specific order.<br>In area 1 : Boulder Hill, his first task is to recover his own mask and later an abducted agent. However it's not just a case of driving around until the agent is found. Matt must first and collect a scanner which will direct him the missing agent (who will be hidden). However the agent cannot be picked up until his mask has been collected and the scanner will not function until the four pieces of the security key have been collected and assembled. Items, including bombs, are collected by driving over them. Bombs are Matt's only weapon against V.E.N.O.M.'s tanks and, as bombs do, they will damage Matt and his vehicle if he's too close to the explosion.<br><br>The remainder of the game consists of three more areas, Prehistoric, Far Future, and VENOM Base each of which have two abducted agents to rescue.

As the game starts, the beasts are tunnelling beneath the Shadowlands and approaching Eternia. As Adam AKA He-Man, can you stop Skeletor and his evil plan before it is too late?<br><br>The game is reasonably easy by adventure standards, and uses a largely two-word parser with commands such as ENLIST, EXAMINE and FIT.

Description=This game is based on a 1984 British television movie which led to a 14-episode television series that ran in 1987 in the U.S.  It's an early cyberpunk vision set "twenty minutes in the future" where powerful corporations rule and compete for television ratings and consumer dollars.  Edison Carter is an investigative reporter for Network 23 seeking to free his alter ego Max Headroom, a cybernetic construct of his mind that was stored after Edison was involved in a motorcycle accident and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a "Max Headroom" sign going into a tunnel.  Max lives in computers and can appear on any screen, television or any electronic device.  The character is actually Matt Frewer in a latex mask, edited so as to appear jittery and stuttering like an early computer model.  <br><br>In the game, Max has been abducted by Network 23 and you must retrieve him from somewhere in the 11 top floors of their high-rise building starting at the 200th floor.  Security systems protect each floor and you have to find and enter the correct codes to gain access from the elevators.  Each floor seen in isometric view, has lines representing walls of various rooms with doors and office furniture.  Robots will chase and fire at you and decrease your health level as shown on the biomonitor at bottom of screen.  Also indicated are the floor number and time left.  On the right side of screen are 4 icons for Reporter E. Carter which open a door, call elevator, view through camera, or allow movement to run around the floor.  On the left side are icons for Controller T. Jones (Theora helps you hack into systems) to show you the floor and computer circuits.  <br><br>When entering a security code, it takes the form of an LED digit over which you must move a pointer over a row of circuit lines in order to activate various segments to form a desired digit.  Each segment will remain lit only temporarily so when time runs out you must ensure that the letter is fully lit or your code will fail.  In that event, you must make your way across the floor to the second elevator and try again.

Description=In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.<br><br>This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

Embark on a glorious journey then save the world of CRON and yourself.<br><br>A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.

The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to  catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others.<br><br>In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts.

On each of the 50 levels you must guide it from a starting point to an ending point, taking out all the enemies along the way. Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this – reaching many of them will involve several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.

Unlike some other trivia games from that period of time, you have to type in your answers to the exact letter. If you're wrong, the Trivia Monster screams bloodcurdlingly or tries to break the door separating you from your "lunch date".

Description=You play as a treasure hunter named Panama Joe, whose goal is to find an ancient treasure hidden by Aztec warrior  deep inside catacombs. But beware, the catacombs are a large maze inhabited by monsters. Bouncing and rolling skulls, dancing spiders, disappearing and re-appearing chains and tons of fire await you. You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.

Description=Moondust is an experimental game by virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier. It fuses together a complex control mechanic with a musical score generated by the player's movement. It consists of different scenes that show a space walker and six space ships floating around and bouncing off the sides of the screen. Even though they all go in a different direction, the player controls them all at the same time using a joystick. However, they only curve gradually into a new direction and are hard to control. When everybody moves in a new direction, the space walker's head becomes loose and follows the desired direction, while the body only slowly attaches itself again. Ships do not always obey the joystick. When they come close to the edge of the screen, they become dizzy and won't follow commands for a short time. Pressing the fire button changes everyone's movement to clockwise or counter-clockwise.<br><br>With a press of a button the space walker drops a seed, but only when he isn't near the middle of the screen. To progress, the space ships need to be steered towards the seed. Once they hit it, they will draw it out and spread the seed for a short time, and to progress, this needs to be done towards a circular sign usually in the middle of the screen as a form of rudimentary astral procreation. A single seed can be smeared out by multiple ships for a short time. Each smeared out seed drop inside the circle is awarded with a score and when a ship gets to spread it very close to the centre of the circle, a "bullseye" is awarded with maximum points and an extra seed. To progress to a new screen a sufficient amount of seed needs to be carried inside the circle. Scores are higher when the initial seed of the space walker is dropped further from the middle. In later levels the circle becomes smaller and initially the space man only has three seeds before the game is over. There is no time limit for dropping the seed. The space walker cannot smear the seed, except in the Spinsanity game mode, and to a limited degree. Sometimes the space walker is knocked out by the space ships in a collision. This may only happen a certain number of times and with each knock-out his colour changes.<br><br>Music consists of blips and electronic sounds that blend together in harmonies influenced by the player's movement and the spread of seed squares. There are also four different playing styles to choose from.

From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

Description=One of the oldest releases by The Learning Company, Moptown Parade is an edutainment game aimed at teaching basic pattern recognition and logic skills to kids aged 4-7. The goal is simple: choose the traits of Moppet creatures to line up in a queue, obeying the given number of rules. For instance, if the rule says "2," you must choose the traits of the next Moppet so that it differs from the previous Moppet by 2 traits, e.g. a fat, blue Moppet can stand next to a thin, red Moppet. The number of rules, i.e. traits, can be changed from 1 to 4, thus either making the game more or less challenging (although changing the traits to 4, the maximum, will just result in your Moppets being an alternate sequence of two types of Moppets).

There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. <br><br>The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.

Description=Mr. Wimpy is a one-player game, where the character controls Mr. Wimpy whose favorite hobby is making tasty hamburgers. In level one, you are required to bring back each ingredient (cheese, beef patty, and sausage) separately on each of the three trays provided. <br><br>Once you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la Burger Time. The object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen.<br><br>When the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next level. The more levels you proceed, the more difficult your quest is.

Description=M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.<br><br>You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.<br><br>Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.<br><br>After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.<br><br>After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.<br><br>Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. <br><br>There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:<br>- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.<br>- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.<br>- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).<br>- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.<br>- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.<br>- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.<br>- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.<br>- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.<br><br>M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. <br><br>M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.

In order to solve the case, you will need to find enough evidence to accuse the correct person. Clues can be found by searching the various rooms, and also from interrogating the fifteen passengers on board. When you come across a passenger, you can question them by being polite, forceful, naive, or whatever approach you think will get you the most information. You can even ignore passengers, but ignoring someone now may make them reluctant to help you later! By piecing the evidence together you need to come up with the killer before time runs out. You may play the game as one of eight different detectives, and each time you play the killer, his/her motive, and the various clues will be different.

Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.<br><br>More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.

Description=This was the first videogame based on C.S. Lewis' ever popular Narnia series of books which started with The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe.  The game came with the first novel, game cards and dice that are used in the gameplay.  <br><br>In the first episode, the witch has frozen Narnia and sent evil dwarves to stomp on flowers and beavers and to stop you from becoming strong.  You gain heart points by touching flowers and beavers and gradually turn Narnia green again.  You must get 10 hearts before time runs out.  If a dwarf comes into contact with you, he goes into a battlefield with you where you roll the dice to come up with a number higher than the one it gets or you lose one heart.  Edmund will appear occasionally and be powerless to go to the witch unless you intercept him or else the game ends.<br><br>In episode 2, you are in an ice maze and must reach the lion Aslan.  The witch will send crystals at you which if they make contact will take away a heart.  There's three gravity chutes which if stepped on will send you to the bottom of the maze.  You collect flowers for extra points and if you reach a door, you go to a card sub-adventure.  The cards will have dice game such as the wolf Fenris Ulf will dare you to roll odd numbers or the witch Jadis will challenge you to get a higher second dice roll than your first.

Description=The first wargame from legendary game designer Sid Meier, NATO Commander puts the player in charge of the armies of Western Europe as the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces plunge across central Europe in a hypothetical Cold War-turned-World War III scenario.<br><br>The game design would serve as the foundation for the MicroProse Command Series of wargames, so it is no surprise that NATO Commander and those later MicroProse games are very similar.  Combat takes place in accelerated real-time, though the player can freeze to survey the field and issue orders.  Commanding is basically a matter of picking the right "modes" for individual units and moving them into position for attack or defense, monitoring unit morale, assigning air wings to various tasks (air superiority, ground support, or reconnaissance), and making judicious use of the chemical and nuclear weapons at the player's disposal.<br><br>There are four difficulty levels and five different scenarios to choose from, and the player has the option of using larger divisions or smaller brigades as the standard unit size.  Victory points are determined by political (city captures, chemical and nuclear weapons use, pre-emptive attack, etc.) and combat (casualties and loss of territory) factors.  <br><br>Key political events occur during the course of the war, such as labor strikes and declarations of neutrality by certain European nations.  The final outcome is eventually determined when accumulated political and combat losses force one of the two sides to accept defeat.

Cook. <br><br>If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. <br><br>In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

As the stroke is being played it is possible to fine-tune the shot and adjust the direction and strength.<br><br>Once the ball has been struck in the lower part of the screen, the upper part of the screen shows a top down view of the ball travelling over the course. When the ball has come to rest the player repeats the cycle until the ball is in the hole. The process is repeated until the game is complete

An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.

Each level is divided into a shooter and a platformer portion. During the shooter portion, the screen is split in half showing your ship from the side and from above. This means you cannot only move the ship forward, backward, up and down, but also to the left and to the right (by holding down the fire-button which enables you to control the ship's sideway movements in the bottom half of the screen). The ship fires automatically and once a certain number of enemies is destroyed or a time limit is reached, you have to maneuver your ship onto a certain spot and enter the city.<br><br>Inside the cities you must jump and shoot your way through five screen-sized rooms. Destroying "evil eyes" will reward you with bonus points. All other enemies cannot be damaged by your weapon and have to be avoided, which is made difficult by the fact that you cannot control your jump in the air.

During the game you will need to survey different lands ranging from the arctic to the desert for oil potential, choose the best sites and drill! Congress may pass bills from time to time which forbid drilling in parks and other reserved lands, which may or may not affect a players strategy. Several modes of gameplay are featured, including  regular classic, reality mode (oil locations are more randomized at the beginning of the game, and costs are supposed to more closely resemble those in real life), and customized modes. Included with the game is a game board with a 50x40 grid of the landscapes you can drill in, and dozens of game pieces to keep track of which locations belong to a player and where oil has (or has not) been discovered. This makes Oil Barons resemble a board game, but with a computer to do the bookkeeping and add a random element instead of dice.

Description=Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.<br><br>There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.<br><br>You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.<br><br>There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.

Can you carry the day?<br><br>Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. <br><br>You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. <br><br>Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

Description=Do you have what it takes to become a park ranger? This game will test you to see if you're really up to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to jump back out again.<br><br>Besides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you  can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at once.<br><br>This game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.

Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. <br><br>At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.<br><br>Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.<br><br>The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points.

Description=Perseus & Andromeda is Number 9 in the Mysterious Adventures series. As the title implies, this one involves Greek mythology involving characters Perseus and Andromeda. Hero Perseus must slay Medusa and rescue Princess Andromeda  who will then become his bride. To accomplish this, he must arm himself with a sword, shield and sandals.<br><br>This game follows the Perseus mythology story closely (as seen in the movie "Clash of the Titans" for example).  Many puzzles involve giving an object to someone, who then gives Perseus another object. Entering temples and praying can produce plot-advancing events.<br><br>Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously, although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.

The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.<br><br>The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.

Your oxygen also depletes, but you can restock on this as well.<br><br>Your task of finding the uranium cube is made hard by three types of force fields, which block different sections of the asteroid. Each type can be deactivated for a different period of time by standing on their respective control pads. To make matters worse, creatures known as Phantoms know about your task and will home in on your location. The only thing that they do is disappear upon contact, draining your energy in the process. Like oxygen and fuel, energy can be restored by finding energy depots.<br><br>Other hazards to be on the look out for include fire, spikes, and poisonous plants. If you make contact with any of these, the game is over. Once you have found all the uranium cubes and gathered them in one place, you have five minutes to reach the teleport and escape before the nuclear explosion blows up the asteroid. You can save and load games anytime during the game.

It is rumored that the chambers contain dark and terrible dangers for those that would make the pharaoh's treasure their own. And even more ghastly, the pharaoh and the guardian mummy are said to walk the chambers for all eternity, destroying all trespassers in the tomb.<br><br>You've heard it all before and lived to tell about it and this is a chance of a lifetime.

A secret tomb that has for 43 centuries stood undisturbed... untouched... unknown and unentered. The ancient pharaoh who lies buried within the vast twisting underground chambers was the 16th and last of a vast dynasty. His treasure, the gold, the art, the jewel encrusted sacred scarabs, all lie with him in the untouched chambers of the crypt. Unimaginable wealth for any but an emperor has lured you here and now you must descend...<br><br>Before his death, the pharaoh vowed that he himself and his hideous minions of the underworld must protect his treasure from all who dare defile his timeless tomb.<br><br>And so you must slip past his sentries and deathtraps that riddle the passages and shafts of his monument, and steal the treasures before you perish.<br><br>As an adventurer, you must explore the pyramid in search of these treasures, while on the lookout for both the mummy and the pharaoh, who will shoot at you if you are caught. You will be awarded an extra life for each treasure you get. There is also the winged avenger. This creature does not harm you, but if you are caught in his grasp, he will take you elsewhere in the pyramid. <br><br>There are keys that can be collected, and can open locked doors so that you can visit new chambers in the pyramid. You lose keys when you get carried away by the winged avatar or lose one of your lives. There are three levels.

Your performance on one mission won't have an affect on future ones, and you can choose to play missions out of order as well.  Several missions include other craft you can control to help out (both ships and helicopters).

Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.<br><br>In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.

There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.

Description=Your spaceship will approach a pit. After it lands, your job is to collect the diamonds and gems in the pit before the tank completely blows away the terrain separating it and the spaceship. Once you have collected all the gems and diamonds, you need to make your way back to the spaceship. Sounds easy? Think again. Upon entering the pit, you will cause a rock to fall down and block the easy way out. The only way out is through the monster's lair. (A red line will separate you and the monster, and this line shortens in length as you walk further.) Last but not least, if the terrain is blown away, the spaceship will leave without you.<br><br>The tank will also release soldiers that have one mission: seek and destroy you. However, you are equipped with a gun, and you use it to blow them away when they get in your way.

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.<br><br>The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.<br><br>The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.<br><br>After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.<br><br>Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

Description=As one of the four great Gods Apollo, Hermes, Hecate and Aphrodite, choose a team of four mighty warriors to fight for you in the Powerplay tournament to prove who is the greatest. This battle will be fought out not using swords or knives, but with knowledge - gameplay takes the form of a complex quiz on a chess-like board.<br><br>You have four playing pieces, which start off arranged as a cross in one corner of the isometrically-viewed board. The squares are split into four different colours, which each represent a particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject area. The question has four possible answers, and a correct answer allows you to move your piece one space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport squares (which randomly places it on one of those four squares).<br><br>When a piece lands on the same square as an opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays out like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick fire and the first player to answer gaining a point if right and losing one if wrong. The losing piece drops down a skill level.<br><br>Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to beat, but makes the questions it faces harder.

Description=This is a Boulder Dash clone, where players has to collect a number of diamonds before time runs out. Boulders (or “rockstones”, as the game describes them) scattered throughout each room can be used to the player's advantage. Removing the earth in which boulders rest cause these boulders to fall down until they hit the next piece of earth, creating a path in which the player can navigate to other areas by. Also, boulders can be used to crush any pumpkins and ghosts that are nearby.<br><br>Other obstacles include changers and destructible walls. Changers create diamonds if boulders are placed on top of them, and destructible walls need to be destroyed in order to access passages that were previously sealed. Once players collect the last required diamond, they can proceed to the next room where more diamonds await them.

Description=In this platform game featuring over 2500 screens, our hero is in search of hidden treasures across worlds such as caves and castles, and must collect it all to advance onto the next level. The twist, as you may guess from the title, is that his weapon is a hammer which can be used to burrow into the ground. The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used by the cunning player to trap an enemy. <br><br>Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of Rick Dangerous-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't drill through them Worms-style)

Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.<br><br>As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.

You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely.<br>   The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a &quot;plot&quot; than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between &quot;stages&quot; - the whole game play is continuous).

Take your fighter across 16 bases, on land, on sea, on the moon, and in space.<br><br>Psycastria is a side-scrolling shooter. Go across each base, destroy the 10 energy pods that power the Psycastrian war machine while avoiding buildings and engaging alien spacecraft, then go to the next base. Unusually for a shooter, you can turn around at any time to go after any missed targets. Between bases, there is a bonus level that tests your timing at destroying aliens.

Description=Psycho is a graphic adventure game with a key-based verb interface.<br><br>A set of jewels has been stolen. At the time of the theft, a curator was with the jewels, so he got stolen, too. And who's the suspect? Norman Bates, of course. The next night, a daring detective drives out to the sinister Bates Motel. His plan: a) find the jewels, b) free the curator and c) take a nice hot shower, should time suffice.<br><br>Psycho is entirely controlled with the keyboard: direction keys for moving your character around, shortcut keys for performing actions. You need to stand close to an interesting object in order to examine it. Adversaries will appear at random throughout the house, putting you to sleep by touch and thus draining your precious time -- you've only got four hours to solve the case. You may shoot the enemies as soon as you find a weapon. As there is no other option for character interaction, this is how you'll deal with the Bates family as well.

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.<br><br>There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)<br><br>The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

This hunchback, for instance, can fight back -- grabbing a rock from a nearby pile he handily hurls it down at the intruder, knocking him off his ladder.  But another is set up, and another... soon Quasimodo is singlehandedly fending off a veritable siege, tossing rocks left, right, down and to the lower diagonals as squirming masses of bad guys return fire with arrows that bounce off the walls!  Yet as soon as it began... all is quiet once more, your sole companion an endlessly-flapping bat (who kills you should he absentmindedly drift into your path).<br><br>The game shifts gears here, the joystick's action button switching duties from rock-lobbing to jumping.  No other humans will be seen for quite some time as you scurry up ladders and swing yourself across ropes dangling from massive ceiling-mounted bells, all in pursuit of gleaming gems to deposit in basement altars.  Every time you do so another area of the game will be opened up, and you get to undertake the grand circuit once more -- again fending off the ladder-climbers, swinging across the same pits (the only time you enjoy bat-immunity, though they don't make any conscious effort to seek out your close company), dodging the same bats (the flock increased by an extra bat each time through).  At the very pinnacle of your medieval structure you will have to climb a sheer wall face while dodging (and returning) arrows shot by archers in the window and (now the tables are turned!) boulders rolled down from the parapets.  (Parapets?  This, then, is no Notre-Dame!)  And then the gem is got, and back down again, and so forth and so on; the cycle turns on, endless labour without even a rumour of beloved Esmeralda!  What motivates this Sysiphean hunchback?  All work and no play make Quasimodo go something something...

You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!

Description=In this adventure game, the player begins as a peasant whose land is under attack by monsters.  After killing one, a princess names  the peasant champion, and issues a quest, to rid the country of enemies.  She can provide no map, but says that part of the quest involves learning the layout of the land by traveling it...and so the game begins.<br><br>The ultimate objective is to find and defeat the wizard Mantor, and recover a magic book which gives him the ability to flood the land with monsters.<br><br>The game is played on a two-dimensional scrolling map.  Everything is represented by a sprite: towns, monsters, trees, hills.  The sprite which represents the player changes, depending on which mode of transportation is used -- beginning, for instance, on foot.  Dungeons in the endgame are done in a three dimensional style similar to The Bard's Tale.<br><br>The player may be a rising hero, but even still heroes need money with which to buy tools and weapons and even food -- starvation is a real possibility!  One source of food and gold is hunting game animals -- some can be eaten, and many carry gold.  Then there are further opportunities in the various towns...<br><br>The Questron hero does not have to be perfect; the game makes concessions to moral ambiguity.  In town, the option is given of robbing the merchants -- of course, there are guards... Money can also be raised by gambling.

Instead of just entering short verb commands, the player is able to type relatively complex instructions, that have to be understood by Gorn in order to perform the necessary action.

In this game, players control a rabbit that must navigate a maze tracking down her four babies without getting hit by the hunter's shots. The hunter moves around so that he can get a clear shot of the rabbit.<br><br>Once the rabbit has collected her babies, she then makes her way through her burrow which is infested with creatures, to the vegetable garden where there is plenty of juicy carrots for her to munch on. She has a limited amount of time to do this, and to make matters worse, a bird flying overhead tries to bomb her with its dropping as it flies past her. However, if she drinks from some of the fountains around the garden, the bird will stop the droppings for a few seconds, allowing her to get more carrots without any trouble. Once she has eaten all the carrots, she is able to make her way back through her burrow and to try her luck again.<br><br>She had better do a good job, because if she fails, one of the meals on the owner's menu will be rabbit pie.

Description=Tetris meets shoot-'em-up, Rampart was originally a one or two-player arcade game combining strategy and artillery action. Build your castle from Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. Later arcade revisions incorporated 3-player,  and the PC conversion does as well, making it a faithful, entertaining classic for multiple players on the same PC.

Description=Not to be confused with Atari Games' Rampart, Ramparts is in fact a clone of Bally Midways' Rampage, but with a medieval theme, and players are giant knights instead of monsters. The game is for one or two players simultaneously, and each has the opportunity to enter in a five-character name before play begins, which will subsequently be displayed next to individual scores during play. <br><br>The game takes place on a single screen, where the player(s) can move left and right on one foreground plane, and the object is to destroy a castle, each phase, by scaling and punching the individual buildings until each, and all collapses. Buildings will often overlap, requiring some to be taken down before others. Players will be harassed by witches, goblins, archers and the like. <br><br>The back story concerns two knights, Sir Griswold and Sir Larkin, who have had a curse set upon them to be transformed into giants by the Evil One, and they must quest for the fiend, so that they may be restored to mere mortals.

Description=The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.<br><br>Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.<br><br>The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.<br><br>This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.

Most elements of the trademark Fighting Fantasy RPG system, including the randomness of even simulated die-rolls, have been streamlined out, leaving only metrics for damage taken and hunger (hitherto untracked in the books.)  Carrying limits, while atypical in FF gamebooks, are enforced here as in the original book.<br><br>A further new dynamic includes the strict timetable of the space traffic control towers -- you need to have wrapped up your business planetside before your launch window comes up, otherwise you're out of luck.  In keeping with the game's sci-fi setting (in both rural and urban flavours), you will find extensive use of objects such as your limcom, nutritious hcaps (tasty like dead Zorkons, num num!), and the indispensable lite-kube.  Combat has been largely phased out in favour of an extension of the gamebook's espionage theme of ciphers and passwords, magic words with the power of plot advancement.<br><br>A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.

As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels.<br><br>One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.

Description=This is the conversion of Taito's scrolling beat 'em up, which later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter.  The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.

Description=Renegade 3 was the third and last in the Imagine's series, based on the original coin-op by Taito. The hero's girlfriend has been beamed into the future, while the man himself has been sent back into prehistory. This sets the scene for a sideways scrolling arena combat game, where the player fights in various time periods. The settings varied from Egyptian and medieval, to a futuristic level. As such, gone are the attacks of street gangs from the first two iterations of the series, replaced by assailants such as knights in armor and robots. In each level you have six minutes to reach the finish, as this is all the time the time-travel portal is available for. There are many surface hazards to avoid, as well as multi-layered Green Beret-style areas. You can kick and punch at different heights, allowing you to deal with each of the diverse foes.

The Quarriers try to build the enemy base by stealing parts of yours. The Drayns steal energy from you and then supply it to the enemy. Fortunately you can steal back the energy they take, but you can't steal back parts of your base. The other six enemies just try to kill you. The bigger the enemy base gets, the more rapidly and accurately they can launch enemies at you.

A timer counts down from 1000 to zero, representing your score - zero means you're out of time.<br><br>There is no fire truck at the building when you arrive, so you have to catch the people who are in the building from falling to their doom, while avoiding falling flower pots. When three flower pots have hit you, this round of the game ends and the fire truck arrives. The goal is therefore to build up as many points as possible by avoiding these pots.<br><br>After the fire truck comes, you can enter the blazing building to scour for survivors. You have to rescue everyone in the building before the fires in the building burn you to death. This is done by touching them to lead them, then moving to a window, without being hit by the fireballs.

For a start, no weapons are to be used. On the top of each Eggship is an Egg destruct pad. Coming into contact with the pad causes the Eggship to explode and a Yolk Helmet is left behind to drop onto it reaches a ledge. Edward needs to collect the Yolk Helmet. Failure to do so will result in it being transformed into a Colonial Warrior. To make the battle fair, Edward's ship is also equipped with a Egg destruct pad, and the ship can explode the same way.<br><br>Besides the Space Warriors and the Colonial Warrior, there is also the Grand Egg. Once proud leader of Egg, he roams the Egg Battle Platforms and destroys any Egg inhabitant who comes into contact with him. Each wave is completed once all the Space Warriors have been destroyed by Edward.

Description=Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than on character stats.<br><br>The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos' minions, and leaves his home village. <br><br>After "character creation" (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way.<br><br>The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of the game is played in towns or travelling between them.<br><br>When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are "magic mushrooms" and some other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this game.<br><br>While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos' minions, which results in some pseudo-real time combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course.<br><br>The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and you have to prepare the spell first.<br> <br>The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, like "G" for getting things or "C" for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and loaded at the main menu.

Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.

Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion.

Description=You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.<br><br>To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.<br><br>Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

Description=Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. <br><br>Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.<br><br>The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.

Description=An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING.)<br><br>At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.<br><br>Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!<br><br>Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.

Description="Save New York" is a shooter where the action takes place on one screen only; but there are lots of things going on on that screen. You see blue sky over skyscrapers and subway tunnels beneath. New York is under attack, and you are a pilot in a little blue airplane who must save it from destruction caused by aliens. At the beginning of each stage, the aliens begin to drop from the sky. Your goal is to cruise around in your plane and to shoot them, preferably before they descend on a building, because then they will begin to crush it until it is destroyed completely. Once you have disposed of such an alien wave, you enter the next stage, with tougher and more numerous foes. Your plane might run out of fuel; in this case, you must pick up fuel left by friendly planes who appear sometimes on the screen. Often an alien will lay an egg on the ground, and a newly born baby will immediately begin to destroy the buildings from below. To prevent this, you will have to leave your craft, enter the dangerous subway tunnels, and dispose of the young alien using your handgun.

Description=Scenario is a turn-based strategy game, where your goal is to conquer the whole Europe. The game takes place on a map of Europe divided into a number of provinces. There are 4 players, each of which can be human or computer-controlled, and each player starts with 1 province and a small army in it. The rest of the provinces are independent countries, just waiting to be conquered...<br><br>Armies consist of tanks, airplanes and ships. Each turn, you can freely move your forces between your provinces or attack neighbouring provinces (though each tank, plane and ship can be moved only once per turn.) Note that a ship automatically takes a number of tanks and airplanes when you move it. When you attack a province, whether it's controlled by another player or neutral, you can see how the battle goes. Of course, if you emerge victorious by destroying the opposing army, you take over the country. If there's no army in that country, you take it without combat at all. <br><br>Producing new armies costs money. You get money from taxes paid by your citizens, but to get cash, you can invest into mining for raw materials (coal, iron or copper); their prices change each turn, but you can usually get a lot of profits - but raw materials eventually run out, and if you invest into a depleted resource, you'll just waste your money (though you can pay 250,000 money to make an analysis and see how much resources you have left in a province). Another way to earn money is to send your ships to overseas colonies to get money from them. <br><br>To build new armies, you first have to build factories in your provinces (a factory costs 200,000); each factory produces a specific type of military units, and has a limit as to how many units it can make per turn. You can also build fortifications to make your army a bit stronger when defending the province. Also note that if you have a lot of money, you can simply pay a lot of cash to revolutionaries in an enemy province - they'll revolt against their government and the country will become a part of your empire. <br><br>Each turn, there are a few random events, such as worker strikes (cannot dig for raw materials) or discovery of a gold mine (cash bonus). You are sometimes given an opportunity to destroy a factory in an enemy province; if you do this, you take part in a short arcade sequence where you have to quickly aim and shoot five guards in the head before the time runs out - and you have a limited number of bullets.

To replenish the fuel supply, you must bomb the fuel depots which will appear on the ground occasionally.

(Players hoping for the books' third dynamic are, well, out of LUCK.)<br><br>An additional extraordinary element is carried over from the gamebook: ship-to-ship combat, with your crew manifest standing in to represent an analogue to your boat's STAMINA score (ability to sustain further damage) -- handy to maintain at high levels while attempting to fend off menaces both nautical and land-based drawn from many fabulous and folkloric sources including Homer's Odyssey and the annals of Arabian hero Sinbad the Sailor.  The conversion also continues the imposition of the text adventure convention of carry limits unknown in the gamebook, as well as pre-set character stats.  Perhaps in an attempt to increase the game's length (at the cost of its replayability), mutually exclusive side-quests from the gamebook all become mandatory stops here toward a larger new goal of not merely maximising one's treasure-accumulation, but systematically denuding the entire coast of anything shiny and not nailed down.

Unlike the previous games, there is no &quot;world map&quot; traveling in Secret of the Silver Blades. All the exploration takes place in the 3D world.

Description=A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond<br><br>The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel,  a statue-like being with an energy draining stare,  you begin at the lowest.  "Energy" plays an important role,  there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.<br><br>The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. <br><br>The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze,  or rather the square you are standing on can be seen,  you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher,  and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then teleported to,  making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created,  trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. <br><br>There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a "Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.<br><br>Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.

Description=In Serpentine you control a multi-segmented snake in a maze; your goal is to survive and earn as many points as possible. At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.

As you established forts and missions and brought back gold to Spain you would receive promotions from the Queen of Spain. The game featured a large world to explore and came up with some clever arcade sequences to simulate the interaction of the Natives and Spanish who did not speak the same language. The historical map accurately spreads out the Native population of the New World in 1492 and some historical situations can be simulated such as whether to get the gold of the Aztec and Incas by trade or conquest.

The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.

Description=Silent Shadow is an arcade with a small aerofighter as protagonist. The objective of the game is to get unharmed with maximum discretion a huge bomber to destroy the enemy fleet in the Persian Gulf. To do so the player has a modern and sophisticated fighter whose power, speed and ability can get to create false images on the radar, making it worthy of the Silent Shadow nickname.<br><br>To achieve the goal 4 phases must be overcome (airbase enemy, city, desert and the enemy fleet). The idea is not to depart too much from the bomber to avoid being hit by enemy fire, being destroyed and ending the game, but neither should you go too  slow because you could clash with the bomber, then losing the few opportunities you have. Expansionary pumps are available that can destroy all enemies in sight. The game allows collaborative game where up to 2 players can take one aerofighter.

Kick cans over, litter to collect and obstacles to avoid in the shape of cones, ramps, sand, bouncing balls, flying frisbees, mazes of tyres and rocks, and even other skaters. Finishing each level is a battle against time to negotiate a series of gates in a set order, the next gate being signified by a row of dots which flash between its flags. <br><br>To complete rounds successfully, though, suitably impressive stunts and tricks are carried out to appease a set of four judges. Each have a card which they periodically display at the bottom of the screen, notifying the player of his progress. When the player's energetic jumping skills have gained enough points to qualify, he skates through the finishing gate and has his performance rated. Failing to qualify forces the player to skate around the car park against the clock, picking up a set number of pieces of litter. Beating a level allows the player to skate to the level's exit ramp, from where he chooses to move up to the next level or leave the car park and move onto the next part of the game, 'The Skate Crazy Championship Course'. <br><br>This section of the game is a race against time over four horizontally scrolling cityscapes of platforms and ramps, with the player building up speed on his skates using a paced joystick waggling movement. Ground level obstacles and gaps in the floor are crossed with leaps of controllable strength and items at head height are avoided by judicious ducking. Birds and other creatures also spell doom for the heroic skater, unless he is able to avoid them or throw things at them. <br><br>Points are scored in this section by picking up extra skating paraphernalia, such as pads, clothes, skates and litter.

Description=The big and nasty Americana monster has come along and eaten up Mastertronic's pinball table where the Slamball family resides, a living clan of ball bearings with a happy deposition. The pinball table is inside the monster's stomach and the balls are in a bit of trouble. The pinball table is still operational, and since the monster's stomach knows that the family is still inside, it has decided to eject them one by one. The hole at the bottom of the table, which normally recovers the ball, instead slides down into the monster's digestive tract. <br><br>Luckily for you, as a member of the secret society of prevention of cruelty to pinballs, have gained radio remote control of the table, and you must now stop at nothing to prevent any of the Slamball family from getting into the Americana Monster's digestive tract.<br><br>The whole game revolves around a vertically scrolling window of four screens that form the entire length of the table. As you launch the ball, you need to decide on the power at which the ball is ejected into the playfield. Four sets of flippers are positioned throughout the table; with the left and right flippers being controlled by pushing left or right on the joystick, respectively. <br><br>All the elements of a real pinball table, such as bumpers and rollbacks, are included here. Even a nudge is implemented in times of extreme danger. Hitting nudge causes the whole table to wobble, and nudge is useful when a member of the Slamball family is in danger of entering the digestive tract. If the nudge gets overused, then the flippers are disabled until the ball reaches the Monster's alimentary canal.<br><br>Around the table are a number of enzymes which are held in groups of up to four. If a slamball comes into contact with these enzymes, the enzymes themselves disappear, and when an entire group is destroyed, a blob appears. If a slamball destroys this blob before it destroys itself by hitting the table's walls, the score multiplier is increased. If all the enzymes are destroyed, the level is complete and a bonus for any balls left is awarded.

Be careful, if you get hit by both a raindrop and a cloud, then your spring rusts and is dragged off by an oil-can.<br><br>In addition to having five lives, you also must avoid running out of points.  An 8000 point bonus appears briefly over various squares, and you need to catch at least some of them, because every jump decreases your points, and getting 'killed' and knocked off the blocks decreases points even faster.

Description=Players control Slippery Sid, who is an espionage agent and son of Blagger. Like the first game, the task is to collect a series of keys scattered around the level. Sid must navigate a series of platforms while jumping over robots that guard the keys. Once Sid collects all the keys, he can make his way to the next level by going through a doorway. Like his father, Sid has a limited time to perform this task, and he loses one of his lives if he fails to collect all of them, or if he falls long distances.

Description=Three of the key battles of the American War of Independence are recreated here. The British army and American patriots can be played by either human or computer (with 3 skill levels). Each side's level of reinforcements and ammunition can be set on a 5-point scale. The smallest and shortest battle is Bunker Hill, while the Battle of Monmouth is distinguished by harsh weather, and Saratoga requires a different fighting style to the highly regimented one the British unsuccessfully used.

Sooty the silent magical bear is one of the UK’s most enduring children’s characters, and his friends Sweep the squeaking dog and Soo the talking bear join him here. The games can be played with little or no computer knowledge, and feature full graphics.<br><br>In Magic Numbers the player must count how many wands Sooty has on the screen. Sweep’s Bones involves moving bones from a pile on the right (Sweep’s stash) to the left (the ones he will enjoy today). Soo’s Hats is an addition test. In Bigger/Smaller you are presented with 2 numbers, and asked to select the biggest or smallest, which Sooty will magic away with his wand. Order Order presents a line of numbers, some of which are filled in, and challenges the player to select the others (which are randomly arranged elsewhere on the screen) and place them in the correct positions. Soo’s Race brings these skills together – you are asked a succession of questions, and answering them correctly will see Sooty’s car move along a track, and hopefully win its race against Sweep.

Description=Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.<br><br>The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.<br><br>Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.<br><br>The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.

Description=As a recruit of the space academy, you must complete numerous tasks, most of which test your dexterity and occasionally requiring some button-mashing. The tasks are divided into fitness training and weapons training. Before you can begin weapons training you must complete the fitness training.<br><br>Fitness training starts with running: waggle the joystick as fast as possible to let the recruit run. After that, you have to balance on a rope: A bar at the bottom of the screen goes left or right, press the joystick into the opposite direction to prevent the recruit from falling off the rope. The next discipline, steeplechase, works similar to running, except that you also have to jump over obstacles. After the steeplechase you must balance on a rope again, but this time you also have to avoid obstacles by ducking or jumping. In the next discipline, the recruit has to hold on to a small device that runs along a rope, pulling up his legs at the right moment to avoid running into obstacles. After that he must jump at the right moment to touch moving targets with his hands, while the grate that he stands keeps getting pulled away. The penultimate discipline requires him to crawl through a narrow tunnel, ducking under obstacles and avoiding laser beams. While the recruit crawls forward automatically, you can only push down to dodge obstacles and keep him still. Don't take too long though, as he is constantly losing stamina. For the last test, the recruit must walk in a hand stand over a grate. Waggle the joystick until the power bar turns red, then press fire to get to the next rod.<br><br>Once the fitness training is complete, the weapons training can begin. Here, several courses have to be completed while either dodging or shooting various obstacles. Sometimes the recruit moves automatically and you can only jump or shoot. Sometimes the recruit can fly and you have full control over him. While it's usually enough to make it to the end of a course, you are sometimes required to destroy a set number of targets.

Description=Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. <br><br>The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.

Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. As the only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue, you swear revenge... but it's a big and expensive universe. In order to upgrade and repair the ship, you'll need credits. Which could be obtained through trading or hunting down pirates or maybe a special mission or two. There's also the matter of finding those who are responsible for the death of the Princess Blue. Following their trail will require obtaining information from several different characters.<br><br>Space Rogue is a space simulation, a predecessor to Origin's better known Wing Commander series and specifically, Wing Commander: Privateer. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. <br><br>Interstellar travel, between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where you must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at your ship, so the faster you can get through them, the more armor your ship retains. Finally, when docked on most locations, the game shows your pilot from a top-view and you can walk to different shops/bars/characters.

Description=Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.

Description=Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.<br><br>You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.<br><br>The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.<br><br>You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.<br><br>A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

You control a pointing finger, which can be moved onto each of the menus to reveal sub-menus, which contain the main options for object manipulation. <br><br>All objects can be examined in detail, which produces a visual display of them, and possible clues as to their usage.

Description=Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.<br><br>Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.

Description=Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.

Description=Alternative World Games Is a series of mini games based around the theme of an Olympiad for the non-sporting minded. It is intended to be a spoof on all serious sporting simulations.<br><br>There are eight games in this compilation, some are one player and some are two player. The minimum number of players names that can be entered is two, the game setup insists that a second player is named because thee are two player games. The maximum number of names that can be entered is six.<br><br>The game menu selection screen has been designed to look like a bank of nine TV screens. Each TV is displaying a sporting channel name. The player selects the channels to be played and presses 'Fire'. This causes an animation to commence on the appropriate TV. The player can select either one or all eight games. Channel nine is used to allow the player to select between competition and practice modes.<br><br>At the end of each game the scores are displayed. After the last game has been played the game displays the medal table, there can be a long wait while the game reads to the end of the tape to find this program.<br>When the selected game(s) have been played the medal table is displayed and the gaming session is over. If further game-play is desired, e.g. for a rematch, then the whole game must be reloaded and the player selection process has to be repeated.<br><br>The eight games are;<br><br>1. The Sack Race<br>This race takes place in Mexico. The objective is to be the first across the finish line. Speed is achieved by pressing left / right alternately while using the up / down keys to steer around open man-hole covers which are the obstacles in this event. Players can play against each other or the computer.<br><br>2. The Pile Of Plates<br>This race takes place in Pisa, Italy. Each player takes it in turn to compete. before starting the up / down keys are used to set the number of plates to be carried. Once set the same keys are used to determine the speed at which the character moves, too fast and plates will fall. A countdown timer starting at 100 is used to ensure that the race is completed in a reasonable time. When the characters are moving the left / right keys can be used to move the characters arms to counteract the wobble.<br>Points are scored for speed of completion, number of plates carried and points are lost for plates dropped, thus a player who carries eight plates across successfully will score more points than a player who started with 30 and finished with 14.<br><br>3. Boot Throwing<br>This event takes place in Italy by the Colosseum. Each player has three turns to see who can throw the boot the furthest. There is a choice of a throwing the boot empty, which means it's lighter so the player has longer to build up speed, or a boot full of water, which is heavier but takes more effort.<br>The player uses the left / right action keys to make the character swing the boot around in a circle. A power indicator shows how much speed has built up, swing for too long however and your character will get tired and lose that turn. At an appropriate point in the swing the player presses 'FIRE'. When all players have thrown the furthest throw wins.<br><br>4. River Jump<br>Each player has three attempts to pole-jump the river. The character starts with their pole up in the air. When the 'FIRE' key is pressed the character automatically starts to run, the player has no control over the speed. However, the pole is heavy and will tend to droop, if it hits the ground while the character is still running then they will fall over. To be successful the character must approach the river with the pole in a (near) horizontal position, if this achieved the character will automatically dip their pole into the river and the player must hit 'FIRE' again to make them release their grip on the pole and, hopefully, land on the other side.<br>5. Pole Climbing<br>This takes place in a castle courtyard and it is a two player game. Players can play each other or they can play against the computer. It is a time limited game where the object is to climb to the top of the pole, collect a bottler of champagne, and safely slide back down inside 5 minutes.<br>The player makes their character climb by repeatedly pressing a specific sequence of up / fire / down.

Description=A conversion of the arcade game, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!) The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limmo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.

Description=Dr. Xavier Tortion (aka Dr. X), jewel thief and smuggler extraordinaire, is on the loose; intelligence reports he is somewhere in North America along with numerous jewels he's stolen. Your job will be to find the jewels and locate Dr. X! <br><br>Adventures in North America is an educational adventure game which is similar to the Carmen Sandiego series of games. In the game you will need to travel to various North American locations to search for clues; some clues have been left behind by friendly agents and indicate where jewels are located. Sometimes you will come across an informant; if bribed with money or jewels, you will receive a clue as to Dr. X's where about. When you think you have enough clues, you can guess where Dr. X is hiding; you only get three guesses though, so if you keep guessing wrong the game will end. If you are successful in your mission, you are given an efficiency rating; the fewer turns you can locate Dr. X in and the more jewels recovered, the better your score will be.

Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).

The Federation is currently at war with Krellans and Zaldrons, so choose your first ship from the Federation starport and prepare for your first mission!<br><br>The graphics of the PC version of Star Fleet I: The War Begins are represented by ASCII characters. Everything from your starship, the mainframe to torpedoes are all ASCII characters. <br><br>Gameplay<br>Gameplay consists of fulfilling the target number enemy kills mentioned in the mission briefing in a specified amount of time. Higher levels demands more kills and less time requirements. Gameplay consists of 2 major areas:<br><br>1. Main Computer and Navigation<br>Your starship is equipped with state of the art navigation equipment. The main screen displays your main visual display, consisting of the main star chart map, your current position and visual displays. Other sections/information of the starship maybe accessed through the appropriate buttons.<br><br>Navigation may be conducted automatically or manually. Standard navigation (automatically) is conducted by accessing the main computer and setting out a course. Higher levels may result on random events during navigation (such as electrical storms, running into asteroids or enemy ships). <br><br>Each map is randomly generated and also uncharted. Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your current surroundings. For even further exploration, your starship also has probes to scan far-away quadrants. <br><br>Combat: Starships, Starbases, and Marines<br>Combat is the essence of gameplay in Star Fleet I: The War Begins. Entities in a combat situation may consist of the following: Your starship, enemy Krellan starships (max 5 per quadrant), enemy cloaked Zaldron starships (usually one per quadrant), allied Starbase  and Space Marines.<br><br>Combat initiates when your starship enters a hostile quadrant (portrayed by a red number on the main map), usually patrolled by a minimum of 1 (one) Krellan starship. Red Alert is automatically set (unless configured otherwise) resulting the rising of shields and direct attack by enemy starships. <br><br>Enemy starships are either Krellan starships or the Zaldron cloaked. Krellan starships fire only phasors to soften up your shields. Although your starship is greatly over-matched compared to a single Krellan starship, numerous enemy ships will prove very dangerous. Zaldron starships are unique as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as their main weapon.<br><br>This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit of moving around when eluding your torpedoes.<br><br>Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some power reserves and enemy prisoners. Be warned that enemy prisoners or enemy spies may board your ship without your knowing and damage your ships systems (indicated by "Intruder Alert"). The enemy ship may then be towed to be transported to a Starbase.<br><br>If enemies prove to much for you and your heavily damaged ship, you can opt for "Self-Destruction". Be warned, you will survive but it may hamper your mission score greatly.<br><br>Unique combat situations refer to "Starbase Under Attack" where an allied Starbase is under attack by enemy starships, requiring your immediate attention for rescue.<br><br>After successfully completing a mission, your mission success is rated: Number of enemies destroyed, captured, starbases rescued, etc. You will then be considered for a promotion or a commendation for a medal!

Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat.

On the moon of a distant planet, mercenaries have been secretly breeding the Tasty Space Griffin and plan to flood the market in order to destabilize it, which they hope will allow them to seize power. Because of an error on part of the notoriously unreliable series seven astroplex, the task to destroy this evil plot rests in the paws of the ill-prepared Captain Rover Pawstrong.<br><br>Players take control of Pawstrong and must help him chase and kill all 20 Space Griffins on (and below) the surface of the moon. The looping playing area is presented from a side-scrolling perspective, with the bottom of the screen showing  a radar indicating the position of Pawstrong and the Space Griffin he is chasing. Pawstrong's health is represented by a cooked Griffin which disappears over time, but gets replenished when a Griffin is caught. The most straight forward and least effective way to catch a Space Griffin is to simply jump on it. It is advisable however, to use some of the items that can be picked up from boxes randomly dropped on the moon's surface by a spaceship. These items include transportation devices like anti-gravity pads or rockets, weapons such as rocket launchers or explosives and food that replenishes some of Pawstrong's health. A mining lamp is needed to see inside the mines under the surface of the moon. Here, Pawstrong can also pick up ammunition for his weapon. When he finds and uses a matter transporter, he is taken to a different part of the moon from where he can attack The Space Griffin with his catapult-style weapon. Finally, a bonus puzzle can be found which requires the player to rearrange a picture, similar to Split Personalities, within a time limit.

Description=Star Ranger is a comparatively slow-paced side-scrolling Shoot'em Up. The player's ship can shoot in two directions, but the shooting frequency is rather low. Unlike in most other Shoot'em Ups, enemies do not simply fly through the screen and can be either destroyed or dodged. Instead, they stay onscreen, trying to destroy the player's ship until they are defeated. There are numerous different enemy types, each following a unique attacking-pattern. Some enemies try to close in, while others always shoot from a distance. There are also bombers, who fill the screen with indestructible bombs, as well as ships that can become temporarily invisible. To further increase the challenge, there are also passages in which asteroids have to be dodged or the ship has to be maneuvered through narrow passages.

Description=Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view

Description=(From Infocom Home Page site)<br><br>After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note.

Description=The ITA Express is under the control of the vicious Redmen, and cannot be allowed to continue its momentum. This is where you come in as a Security Guard, as you start on top of the final carriage of the train and must walk across it, jumping over the gaps, to reach the front. Redmen must be kicked into oblivion with a precise contact before they can throw you off the train; they will also throw knives, which must be ducked. <br><br>You can turn the tables thanks to the Snakebird, which will pick you up if you jump into it, and allow you to drop on top of a Redman. You have a limited amount of time to reach the front, indicated by the ground moving backwards as the train moves forwards. In the second part of the game you are inside the train, trying to survive long enough for the whole thing to begin again with increased difficulty.

Selecting these calls up a sub-menu to choose what should be examined or thrown, which objects to combine, which spells to cast, and so on. The objects to be used include a chicken, a disguise and eggs. One new feature is that bolts of lightning are fired down at Magic Knight from the sky, and these must be avoided.

Shooting out the tanks clears ground space to set up your own bases, which must then be defended.

Once you acquire these, open the door at the farthest left and photograph a woman who tries to look pretty by crossing her legs every five seconds.<br><br>But there's a catch: stopping you from completing your tasks is the hotel inspector, manager, and one of the bar patrons. Furthermore, if you open enough doors to find the items you need, chances are you wake Mr. Angry up, and he'll stop at nothing to make your job harder. More often than not, an item of yours will be behind his door.<br><br>There are 10 screens (or floors) to complete. After 10 screens, the difficulty level gets higher, and new characters start to appear like the chef and the security guard, which makes Mr. Angry even more fun. You also have a deadline in which you have to get everything by. If you fail to meet that deadline, you lose a life. As usual, lose all your lives and the game is over.<br><br>Certain doors are hard to get to unless you use elevators. Your enemies are smart enough to know how to use them, and they can catch you even when you are on these elevators. However, the only thing that they can't use is the conveyor belts on Screens 9 and 10.

This game simulates the stimulation of a phallus by a hand, changing the stroking direction using the joystick or the down and left arrows on the keyboard.  With sufficient speed and rhythm, the phallus will lengthen.  Overstimulation may lead the phallus to change colour, a warning that a premature climax is at the threshold; scaling back the vigorousness of the stimulation allows the player to resume playing for the high score, as measured in total phallic length.  When climax is achieved, or when the timer ticks down, the player's performance is evaluated and scored.

If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily.  The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get.  Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however.  There are no lives in this game.  The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.<br><br>Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible.  By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.<br><br>Note that there is no accelerator in this game.  Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.  Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad.  Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.

It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. <br><br>With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).

Alternative Software turned it into a game two years later, and decided to create a wild mix of space shooter, platform jumping and - of course - beat-em-up action.<br><br>Loosely following the storyline of the film, Hogan alias intergalactic hero Shep Ramsey travels through space, crash-lands on earth and beats up the bad guys. The first level is a R-Type-like horizontal space shooter; destroy formations of drones and collect weapon upgrades. After that, you'll enter three platform levels, in which you have to find nine items each. Avoid being shot and dispatch the enemies with kicks and jumps. After each mission, you’ll encounter the level boss, who you’re supposed to beat up in a Street Fighter clone.<br><br>Apart from a comic-style likeness of Hulk Hogan as the main hero (with a huge head and tiny body -- strange), the game has little reference to the movie.

Description=Sum Ducks is an educational game for children ages 8-12. In the game there is a pool with several ducks swimming around, each duck marked with a number. You are given a target number shown on the scoreboard at the top of the screen. As the ducks swim by, you can toss a ring around a duck which will cause its number to be added to the equation on the scoreboard. Your goal is to create an equation which results in the target number (you need to be exact and can't be over or under). Depending on the game variation, you need to reach the target via addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For example, in the addition game you might be given a target of 50; if you toss a ring around 5 ducks each marked with a 10 then you win that round. Sometimes the ducks can be tricky and may poke their head in the water; if that duck has a number you need, you will first need to toss a ring at the duck to bring his head back up. Also in the division game, if you ring a duck which has a number that is not a factor of the target, then that duck will dive underwater until the next game. In addition to the ducks, from time to time a hippo will appear in the water and offer a number; sometimes this may help you out, if so you can toss a ring to the hippo for the number. The game features both easy and difficult skill levels.

There are 3 skill levels, which affect the amount of time you have to complete the level, and the bonus offered if you manage to (the amount of time left, divided by a set number, bigger on lower levels). Your bike has 3 gears and appears to have a top speed of around 120 MPH. After every 2 races there's a bonus round in which you must pick up as many tokens as possible in the time limit.

Description=What does a brave magician do when the princess gets kidnapped? Well usually nothing since we have brave knights to save her, but not this time. The mighty dragon is holding a princess captive in his lair and our brave magician must rescue her by battling hordes of evil minions in 4 levels of this almost forgotten game.<br><br>The gameplay is a classical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The enemies come in pre-determined patterns and never attack you directly. They are just there for you to avoid or shoot at. <br><br>Shooting enemies gives you points but also builds up your magic points. When you collect enough magic points you'll get a spell to cast. These spell are really useful and quite fun to use. There is a bomb spell that kills everything on the screen and "frog" spell that lets you jump a large holes. Some spells change depending on the level of the game you're playing.<br><br>Speaking of holes, you must remember that in this game holes are your biggest enemies. Most of the time the trick is finding a right place to jump from. You only have one life, you can get a extra life when you kill enough enemies, but one wrong step and you're in the hole and you're dead. Extra life doesn't count for holes.

You are armed with a laser and your Jetpac, which will need recharges of ammunition and fuel - these are dotted along the jagged surface and will require precise positioning to retrieve. There are several teleports along the surface, which will advance you a short way through the level.

There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  <br><br>This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.

Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.<br><br>There are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only lasts for  a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when they match, there will be a large bonus score.<br><br>Occasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets enlarged. The object of these stages is to eat everything in the maze before the time runs out, and during these stages, there will be no ghosts to pursue him.

Once a hole is made in the pipe, the foreman must guide a (green-suited) workman to the hole so it can be repaired. While the workman is mending the leak, he is vulnerable to being knocked off the pipe. <br><br>The foreman is equipped with a gun to shoot enemies, but he can also be knocked off the pipe by the monsters. To make matters more complicated, the lobster can only be attacked from behind (due to its shell) and the "Shower of Tacks" on later levels cannot be shot at all.

There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.<br><br>Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.<br><br>Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.<br><br>Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.

It looks similar to Imagine's Ping Pong but offers more gameplay options. The table is displayed in 3D and you only see the bat (no player or your hand). You can choose if the net will be split horizontally or vertically. Hitting the ball is pretty simple, just press the fire button when the ball comes close to your bat. Depending on if you hit the ball to early or too late it returns in different angles. <br><br>While the program is loading, you have a menu where you can choose several game options like bat control (computer-guided or manual - beginners should start with computer-guided), game speed and if you want to change the sides of the table after each player has served. The most-interesting option is that you can give up to 20 skill points to 6 different hitting-options (like forehand, backhand, smash etc.). Normally the program automatically gives you 12 points overall (2 for each of the 6 hitting options) but you can change this the way you want to have it up to the max of 20 points. So you're able to increase or decrease your skills for your forehand, backhand and smashing abilities and the way you personally prefer your table-tennis gameplay. <br><br>Rules are official table-tennis rules in the 80's, first player reaching 21 points wins the game/set (option setting allows you to play 1, 2, 3 or even more sets for an match). After choosing your side on the table, and the color of your bat the action begins.

Description=Almost a thousand people have been trapped in a hibernation dome after a nuclear war. The player takes control over three droids and must use their abilities to rescue the survivors.<br><br>Seen from a top-down perspective, The Survivors plays somewhat similar to Boulder Dash as the levels are filled with sand and rocks. Droid 1 is the only droid that can dig through the earth, Droid 2 can beam survivors to safety (by moving over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at a time). The goal in each of the seven levels is to rescue all survivors within the time limit, while paying attention not to trap or damage any of the droids. Removing sand or pushing around rocks might cause other rocks to fall down and crash the droids. There are also Guardian Droids whose circuits have been damaged by the nuclear fall-out, causing them to run rampant. They damage the players droids on contact.

There are two types of skulls that are scattered through each level.  One that gives you reverse controls, and one that causes loss of life. When Tarzan has obtained all six ingredients, you proceed onto the next level. In between these, you play a bonus level where the object is to collect a number of gems before time runs out.

Description=A prince has laid eyes on Princess Kelly, but her father, King Otto, is convinced that he is not worthy enough of marrying her. To prove him wrong, King Otto sets the prince a series of seven tasks that he needs to accomplish if he is to win her hand in marriage:<br><br>1. The prince has to survive a night outside the castle. When the sun sets behind the hills, hordes of mortified-looking zombies appear from both sides of the screen, and in order not to be eaten, the prince must shoot them with his arrows until the sun rises.<br><br>2. The prince has been placed somewhere in Dabbit Wood where an evil wizard materializes, fires at him, then dematerializes. With little time in between, he must shoot the wizard the moment the wizard appears.<br><br>3. Four sacred stones need to be recovered from Vampire Mountain. Bats will come out from a cave and fly around the prince in an attempt to stop him from completing his task.<br><br>4. Devil Worshipers from the Temple of Demons have been sent to Stonehenge to wipe out the prince. These worshipers have the ability to fire in all directions. The prince can claim victory if he kills a certain amount of monks.<br><br>5. The ancient spirit stone of the Runes of Tygorth is freeing dangerous spirits, and needs to be destroyed. The stone will take a few hits by the prince, giving time for the spirits to fire at the prince if he gets too close to it.<br><br>6. Ritual stones have been placed in the village of the Northern Barbarians and the prince has the task of retrieving five right ones. Meanwhile, vicious barbarians emerge from the cottage and try to stop the prince from stealing them.<br><br>7. The prince is so close to marrying his love. All he needs to do is to get to the wedding ceremony, held at the Castle of the Birdmen – aptly named because aggressive birds will appear who will swoop down and fire at the prince before he has the chance to get inside.<br><br>If the prince successfully completes all of these tasks, then King Otto will let her daughter be his wife. If he fails, King Otto will not agree to the marriage until all tasks are accomplished.

Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.<br><br>Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places.

There you must brave cruel monsters, ancient deathtraps, fanatical disciples of the cult of Leesha, and the cat-and-mouse depredations of the sinister killer known as the Messenger of Death in your quest to recover the powerful Dragon artefacts before Malbordus can find them and utilise their mystical power to fuel his campaign of carnage.<br><br>A loose adaptation (using many of the original's characters, locations, situations and puzzles but often in new configurations) of Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy gamebook #14, published two years prior, this computer game version merges the gamebook's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure design to the Adventure International text-game-with-graphics model developer Adventure Soft had grown familiar with republishing.  This curious hybrid yields some alternate puzzle solutions that wouldn't have been possible in the original gamebook format, but often imposes extraneous constraints such as carry limits and step-by-step sequences of actions that the book would have effortlessly bundled together in a single multiple-choice paragraph selection.  Curiously, considering the ease with which computers automate data management, the designers chose to reject the trademark Fighting Fantasy SKILL, STAMINA, LUCK RPG stats-management -- distancing the conversion from unfair elements of randomness but placing a new emphasis on adventure game inventory puzzles.<br><br>A version of this game also came out for the BBC Micro.

Description=In They Stole a Million you are The Boss, a would-be criminal mastermind out to seek his fortune the dishonest way. To do this you will have to hire a team of criminals, with skills ranging from explosives to driving - these will each seek an upfront payment and a percentage cut of the eventual profits. You will have to buy information and plans on potential targets - an art gallery and bank for example. Menu options reveal pop-up windows of information and sub-menus.<br><br>Planning the raid itself is your next task. An overhead view of the site is prevented, with your information on doors and storage locations all readily available. You move each member around the map to give them orders, using a displayed clock to ensure that the action timings overlap correctly. Many options bring up sub-menus of icons.<br><br>During the actual crime, you wait outside, with a walkie-talkie to issue orders. Keep an eye out for police cars, as their presence may for you to freeze, or run off with what you have so far. You can enter the site to help out, but this leaves you defenceless if the police arrive.

Description=The Thompson Twins were a popular 80's music pop trio who took their name from the Tin Tin comic book.  In issue 36 of Computer & Video Games magazine dated 10/84, there was attached to the cover, a free flexi-disc which contained a message from the group plus this adventure game program imprinted in the grooves.  Commodore 64 owners had to mail-in an order to receive their free flexi-disc.  You could load the program into the Spectrum by connecting a lead from the headphone socket of your record player to the EAR input on the computer.  Otherwise, you could tape the disc's contents to a cassette player and load the cassette into the computer (this was only way for the Commodore 64).<br><br>  <br>The story is related to their hit single "Doctor! Doctor!" and begins with the Thompson Twins on a beach and then a cave.  Typical of text adventures, you enter directional commands: north, south, east, west as well as in, out, up, down.  Other commands such as look, take, read, dig, and inv (to see what items you are holding in your inventory) are useful.  You must find any items along the way and use them where appropriate.  As part of the promotion, whoever could get through the adventure and find the secret of the Doctor's potion by November 16, had a chance to win a meeting backstage with the group at one of their concerts and other prizes.  Due to delays in producing the Commodore 64 flexi-discs, the deadline was extended to December 31 for those computer owners.

Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.<br><br>The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.<br><br>Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.

Description=Arthur J. Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises.<br><br>Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.

You can arrange friendly matches to try out players and ensure that the squad plays together as much as possible.<br><br>The matches are presented as a running commentary, with a small graphic indicating which area of the pitch the ball is in. A wide range of tactical options are available to dictate the team's passing style, defensive approach and so on, and in another first you can give specific instructions to individual players (maybe telling a particularly pacy defender to man-mark a dangerous opposition winger instead of staying in a set position).

Description=Traffic is a simple game where the player has to guide cars, motorbikes and buses through busy London streets by changing the traffic lights from red to green. The objective in order to advance to the next level is to get a preset number of vehicles through the screen, although it does not matter which exit you direct them through. Cars continue to queue off the edges of the screen (with numbers next to them if there are queued cars beyond your vision) and if the queue reach more than five cars, it's game over. A warning sound is given when five cars are queued; you must hope there are not also queues on surrounding roads. Cars always stay on their side of the road, and collisions are not possible.

You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode in the Lotus games (by the same authors).

Description=Trains is a top-down managerial game. In the age of steam powered trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.

Description=Based on the popular 1980s animated cartoon of the same name, The Decepticons are building a giant robot to threaten the Earth. Players must keep track of their action on a game map and send the appropriate Autobot (Cliffjumper, Bumblebee, Rodimus Prime, Hot Rod, Hound, Pipes, Blurr and Kup are featured) to combat each threat and prevent the Decepticons from stealing energy to build their giant robot. In order to accomplish this, the Decepticons must undergo a sequence of events in their complicated plan that takes place in such locations as: off-shore oil rig, nuclear power plant, Dinosaur Park, space center, Andreas Zoo, and a pipeline.. As a brief overview: First, energy must be collected to power-up a dinosaur in Dinosaur Park. This dinosaur will then be sent to collect Space Dust from the space shuttle before destroying it. The space dust will be used to grow hippopotami to gigantic proportions and use them to collect more energy from the pipeline.  The Autobots' ultimate goal is to interrupt and delay this sequence. <br><br>In Transformers players choose the Autobot to go to locations on the map.  When they reach the location the game switches to a first-person view, and players have to move a cross hair to shoot at a near-endless stream of Decepticon jets that fly onto the screen. Players can be hit by their missiles - too many hits and the screen cracks up and the Autobot is defeated, requiring another one to take it's place.  The more Decepticon jets that are destroyed, the longer it takes for the Decepticons to progress to the next stage of the plan, in sequence.<br><br>The game's intro features over a minute of speech which is notable both in 1984 and for the Commodore 64 platform itself.

In the lakes live crocodiles, which can be used as stepping stones as long as their jaws are closed. In order to cross lakes, lianas may also be used, Tarzan-style. For some reason, there is a big cellar beneath the jungle into which Cuthbert may fall. It may be used as a way to avoid the dangers on the surface, but it is also inhabited by nasties, and you may run into a cul-de-sac. To spice things up, you only have 20 minutes to reach the end.

They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.<br><br>Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the homonymous classic 1883 Scottish novel. Unlike the book, the game is written in second person. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of on-line hint system. The player can ASK them ABOUT anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of the Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.

This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

Description=Turbo Esprit puts you in control of a Lotus Esprit cop car, with the challenge of breaking up a drugs gang and protecting the innocent.<br><br>A map is built into the car, which can instantly show the positions of the baron's cars - this is crucial because you can't interrupt them before the initial deal is done, as this will simply make them leave and try again another time.<br><br>The game's environment is large and varied, with traffic lights, junctions and zebra crossings accurately implemented, and pedestrians to avoid. The roads are multi-laned, and at the end of each road you can turn across, which makes the game's perspective shift in a flick-screen manner. One unusual feature for the time is a saveable high-score table.

Description=Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.<br><br>The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.<br> <br>When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.

As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.<br><br>Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.<br><br>Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon:<br><br>1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up;<br>The laser, which can shoots beams as large as Turrican himself when maxed out;<br> the multiple shot beam, which can shoot up to five beams covering approximately a 90 degree angle.<br><br> <br>The Turrican suit weaponry is not limited to the arm cannon however:<br><br>1. He also can fire a continuous beam, activated by holding the fire button. This beam can be rotated around Turrican, so it is possible to blast things below him in this way;<br>Additionally, he can fire power lines by pressing the space bar, resulting in two energy bars as high as the screen going from the Turrican suit to the left and right of the screen, severely damaging enemies in the process;<br>If the space bar is pressed when the hero is crouching, the Turrican will morph into a shuriken shape. In this state, it will roll to the left or the right, damaging enemies while being invincible and small bombs can be dropped by pressing the fire button;<br>Finally, the most powerful attack, which can only be used one time per life, can be delivered by pressing the fire button and the space bar at the same time. The Turrican suit will morph into a shuriken shape and fly around the screen for several seconds, while firing shots of the different weapons in multiple directions.

Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. <br><br>The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.

Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time. <br><br>Unfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.<br> The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.<br> The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......

You start out at a one of two castles, where you can rest and save your game. The road between the castles is safe, but every other place is teeming with monsters, magic places (upgrading or downgrading your stats) and, of course, treasure. The valley also contains a multi-level tower as well as some swamps and forests, which feature some other dungeons.<br><br>The game is played in a turn-based manner, except fighting which is timed delay. As you only have half a second or so to enter your next move, it gets quite challenging. It is also quite sophisticated for its time: You can attack the monster's head, body or legs, or you can cast one of three magic spells. Of course, some monsters can do the same to you. Finally, you may sometimes surprise a monster, getting a free attack or the choice to retreat (which is not possible in a normal fight).<br><br>Each level is randomly generated at the beginning of the game. The game provides a saving mechanism with 10 possible save games. Despite its simple graphics, the quick and easy gameplay and the challenging combat make this game quite advanced for its time.

Description=The final conflict in the droid wars is up ahead in Jeff Minter's Voidrunner, the second sequel to Gridrunner. After the defeat in the Matrix wars the droids are out for revenge, preparing a nuke to destroy the earth. Therefore a corps of pilots are sent to the droid home planet with the objective to eliminate every single droid.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to Gridrunner. Like in Centipede, the enemies move in a pattern down the screen and the player have to shoot them before they reach the ship. There's also the zapper, a vertically moving line, that occasionally pulses. If the player ship is on the same line when this happen, it will die.<br><br>The enemies come in many different flavours. The most common ones just explodes when hit, bouncing predictable around the screen. We also have the Gridrunner style aliens that when hit leaves a pod that needs to be destroyed. Typical for a Minter games, you'll also fight furry animals like camels and goats.<br><br>New in Voidrunner is that you don't just have one ship, but four. In early levels the ships will move around in a cluster. Later in the game some of your ships will have inverted motion. Some of these formations will have the ships shooting in different directions. Handy when you have enemies coming in from behind.

Description=Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.<br><br>The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.<br><br>As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.

It contains good-luck charms, the sorts of mad scientist chemical concoctions that might well yield a Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation, a flighty medium and her crystal ball, and no small quantity of juju, useful for all sorts of voodoo applications.  All that and a chimneysweep trapped in the flue!  The player will navigate all these and more with the trademark Adventure International VERB NOUN two-word text parser.

Description=Vultures is an original (?) shoot'em'up with a slight Galaga flavour. Above your spaceship hangs a nest of space-vultures. One after one, they come down to shoot at you. Unlike Galaga, they don't wrap at the end of the screen, instead they "bounce" back and forth across it. Mind the vulture's course, because otherwise you might find yourself trapped in a corner with the inevitable collision as only way out. A good tactic to ameliorate your chances is to dodge the vulture's bullets and concentrate your fire on its mates that are left hanging above. When all the vultures are killed, their eggs start to hatch and spawn similarly devious creatures. Shoot them down, and you have passed the first level.<br><br>Vultures has three speed settings and runs in medium resolution with a green background.

Description=The bar-room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special 'double' area around the edge, and a special 'treble' area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a Bullseye right in the middle for 50 points, and an Outer Bull around it, worth 25 points. <br><br>Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce your score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If your score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board you must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top.<br><br>Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players).<br><br>Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.

Description=You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points. <br><br>The action is viewed from the side, scrolling horizontally as you progress, and vertically when you need to jump or duck over the bigger hazards, which must be avoided Moon Patrol style, meaning that you must often time one jump properly so as to be able to make the next one successfully. In some sections of the road you can duck down onto another set of roads, which may or may not be less hazardous. Falling into thin air costs you a life, while heavy impacts deduct some of your energy points. When the view doesn’t show the next section, and the correct course is not clear, an arrow appears to direct you.

Description=Greetings, Professor Falken. Shall we play a game?<br><br>This strategic game is based on the popular 1983 movie of the same name, starring Matthew Broderick. It might remind people of Missile Command but the action is slower and spread over six screens which represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles, planes, and subs will attack and you must direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and satellites, to intercept them. Each type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but limited in range, planes are slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense but are only available every so often. Some weapons aren't available in certain areas, and some enemies are resistant to certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly. <br><br>As your bases and cities are struck, a DefCon indicator for each area will count down and when the overall DefCon reaches 1 for a minute or when all cities and bases are destroyed, a counterstrike is launched and the game is over. The game is won by preventing a counterstrike long enough for a cease-fire to be reached. There's eight different difficulty levels to progress through as you get the hang of it. A two-player mode on the Colecovision lets one player to use the Roller Controller to guide and fire weapons, while the second player inputs keypad commands.

As you explore the maze like dungeon, you will come across various enemies which you can attempt to fight, bribe, hide from or even run away. Different creatures have different weaknesses, so to improve your chance of success you should note the best approach to dealing with a particular enemy. You begin the game with a limited number of hit points, and if you lose them all the game will be over. In addition to the main treasure you are after, you may also discover some additional bonus treasures hidden in various rooms or by bribing creatures. Good luck on your quest!

Description=This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin. All games in this series are early graphical Roguelikes. The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures. <br><br>You explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like "MOVE NORTH" or "LIGHT TORCH". The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move several squares at once (like "MOVE EAST 3") to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is "SPEED", which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires.<br><br>The combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others. You may also "AIM" a hit (which costs some time, but makes the attack more likely to hit) or "FORCE" an attack (this makes it more difficult to hit, but increases the damage). This and the body parts result in a quite tactical combat -- you have to guess or find out the weak parts of your opponent and choose the right way of attacking.<br><br>Kaiv extends the originally quite simple game of Dunzhin by adding a shop at the dungeon entrance where you can equip yourself. You now also have a bigger variety of items like torches, crosses (against Vampires) and mirrors (against Gorgons), and you can also find magical items: several rings, wands or potions that improve your magical or physical protection or increase you fighting skills. You also need to take enough food and drink with you to prevent dying from hunger or thirst.<br><br>The difficulty level of the game is quite high with new characters -- you often die just by being hit once by a low-level monster or by stepping into some trap. The game is generous in allowing you to save your progress at any time.

Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.<br><br>Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

Description=Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.<br><br>It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.<br><br> <br>You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.<br><br>The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps & trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.

Description=Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth. <br><br>In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.

Description=In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.<br><br>The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.<br><br>But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.<br><br>The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.

That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.<br><br>There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.<br><br>There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.

Description=You have landed your crippled ship at the Atargis mining station. The platform was deserted and no one answered your radio calls. Now you are forced to enter the station and find a way to get off the asteroid. Hopefully whatever happened to the 200 personnel in the labyrinth of mines under the station won't happen to you too.<br><br>Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like the Dungeon Master series everything happens in real time. You move around in 10 foot steps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items with, a belt and holster for quick access to weapons as well as an inventory for carrying things.<br><br>The objective of the game is to find parts to repair your ship. You must also find food and water for sustenance and guns, grenades and mines for self defense. Other items can help you during your mission such as environmental suits, security passes and a motion detector. Data disks found throughout the station will fill in the story.

Description=Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.<br><br>Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.<br><br>It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.<br><br>In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.

Description=In Zombi you control a team of four intrepid travelers, who have landed their helicopter on the roof of a shopping centre in the hope of finding fuel. The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please.<br><br>Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. <br><br>Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.

Description=Zone Ranger is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Asteroids. You are the pilot of a spaceship in a deadly region of space. Large killer rocks, rogue satellites, boomerangs, and more all fill this region of space. Using your ships lasers you need to destroy as many of these as you can to earn points. Each level also contains some warp holes; enter one of these and you will be transported to a new location, which could be useful if you get in trouble. You will also occasionally come across some sonic sparklers; touch one of these, and you will temporarily become invincible. Another oddity you may come across is a super portal, which will transport you to the inner sanctum where bonus dots can be found. Lastly, on level one only a warp to the seventh dimension can be found. Lots of points can be earned there, but it's quite difficult so if you take this warp you probably won't last long!

Description=Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game.  The player begins as an "adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen Treasures of Zork. <br><br>As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" command (or just "i"). <br><br>Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the '80s.

Description=Zybex is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up inspired by Side Arms and Nemesis/Gradius. The players took control of prisoners trying to win freedom from a galactic prison. At the end of each level they earned a crystal, opening access to the later levels of the game.<br><br>There are 16 levels in total, with numbers 2-12 immediately available after completing the first - the player can go through them in any order. However, levels 13-16 are locked until the player earns enough crystals.<br><br>The weapon system is quite unique - the player constantly fires, and the fire button is simply used to change the current weapon. The basic weapon is the Orbiter, which the player always has. Picking up weapon icons increases the power of a weapon by 1 up to the maximum of power level 4. Dying reduces the current weapon by 1 power level, or loses it if the weapon is power 1 (with the exception of the Orbiter). As the weapons get more power, their fire rate becomes faster and the bullets stronger. The five weapons are Orbiter, 8-way (upgrades from 2 to 4 to 6 to 8 way fire), Railgun (powerful single bullet which gets longer) Pulse (fires straight forward and gains diagonal fire at power 3/4) and Wall (another forward fire, which gains size).
