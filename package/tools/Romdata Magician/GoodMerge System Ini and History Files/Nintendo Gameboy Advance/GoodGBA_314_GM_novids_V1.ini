You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.<br><br>The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.

There are five levels you can get at each place you need to press the key(s).  If you hit it right on, you get the highest ranking and have a chance to get a style bonus if you can do that 5 times in a row.  If you hit it and are off by a little, you will get one of the other rankings, or the lowest ranking if you miss or press the wrong key.  Sometimes you will also have to hold a press for a length of time and let up at the right moment.<br><br>The game offers many songs, but only 2 voices for each song.  If you are male, you get the male voice; if you are female, you get the female voice.  The lyrics will appear as the song is sung, so if you want to learn the song as well as compete, you can.

Their madcap destruction has caused this dire financial situation, and the CEO, Thaddeus Plotz, has issued an ultimatum: either deliver three feature films on time and as cheaply as possible...or be locked in the Water Tower forever!<br><br>In Lights, Camera, Action!, the player controls all three Animaniacs, as well as Pinky and The Brain.  Each Animaniac has their own abilities and drawbacks - for example, The Brain can activate complex switches, but cannot jump due to his large head, while Dot can glide through the air with her skirt, but refuses to push anything as it will damage her nails.  It's up to the player to switch between each Animaniac as they make their way through each scene, performing the required tasks given by the director.<br><br>The Animaniacs are also never in any real danger - they're only filming.  However, they must always pick up film reels to keep the cameras rolling.  If the player runs out of film, it's game over.  Otherwise, if you fall into water or get hurt, you'll just have to restart the last scene that the director asked you to perform.

Description=Arthur and the Invisibles is an officially licensed game for the French film of the same name (Arthur et les Minimoys in French). Players assume the role of 10 year old Arthur. His grandmother is about to lose her house and Arthur wants to stop this. Instead of the conventional channels Arthur travels to the land of the Minimoys; minuscule creatures just a tenth of an inch tall. Here he searches for his grandfather's treasure together with princess Selenia. This treasure should save the house. But to find it they'll have to travel to the forbidden city ruled by the evil M. the Malicious.<br><br>The Minimoy world consists of the house and its garden, but in an up-scaled size, since the characters are very small. Unlike the PC and console version, which is in 3D, the Game Boy Advance version uses a sidescrolling perspective. The player gets to play as both Arthur, Selenia and her little brother Betamesh. Each character has its own abilities. Arthur is more acrobatic, Selenia has a knife with which she can cut through foliage and Betamesh is smaller and can use this advantage to creep through smaller areas. The story in the game closely follows the script of the film.

It is Chicago, 2055, and you are Travis Ryer, scientist and employee at Time Safari Incorporated (TSI), a business dedicated to taking wealthy clients back in time 65 million years and giving them the chance to do the impossible: hunt a dinosaur.<br><br>Of course, there are dangers: the tiniest change can screw the future up in ways you can't possibly imagine. Somehow, one of the recent clients has managed to accidentally take a butterfly back through time with him. Soon, the present is rocked by time waves, waves which gradually change the future into how the butterfly-less past would have been. Dinosaurs have been popping up around the city, buildings are crumbling and decaying, and the last wave that hits may mean the end of the human race unless Ryer can return the butterfly to the past.<br><br>With a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal, such as grenade launchers, machine guns, stun prods, and time freezing bombs that will freeze all enemies for a short amount of time, plus vehicles such as an ordinary car or a tricked-out ATV, you may just get the necessary edge. You can also battle it out in four-player deathmatch mode or a two-player cooperative mode. You may want to hurry, though: you're racing against time... and time is NOT on your side.

Description=Trouble is brewing in Gotham City: The Joker has another nefarious plan for bringing down Batman. It begins with a break-in at the Gotham Museum and ends with the Joker falling from the Gotham Bridge, apparently to his death (as depicted in the first levels of gameplay). <br>Now, Gotham's other supervillains, including Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy don't rest and want to fill the void left by the Joker. Thankfully, Batman is not alone in his efforts to stop them, as his trusted companions Robin and Batgirl are there to help.<br><br>Batman: Vengeance for the GBA has the same basic story as its counterpart on consoles (and uses stills from that version's rendered sequences for story cutscenes), but differs in gameplay. Both games are inspired by the 1990s Batman animated TV series rather than the comics.<br><br>The game has four different kinds of levels:<br><br>In the side-scrolling levels, Batman runs and jumps from left to right, beating up various henchmen with kicks and punches. He can also use various gadgets: batarangs and smoke bombs to take out enemies and a grappling hook to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.<br><br>In the Batmobile stages, viewed from the top, the Batmobile has to reach a goal within a certain time limit. Naturally, the road is filled with both traffic and other obstacles that take time from the clock or slow Batman down. Thankfully, the Batmobile is equipped with a gun that can take some obstacles out of the way.<br><br>It's Robin and Batgirl's turn in the Batplane stages, which are similar to traditional side-scrolling shoot'em'ups. The Batplane has to be steered through an automatically scrolling landscape, filled with flying hazards and various guns. The plane can be made invulnerable for a short time by employing an energy shield, and it is also equipped with a gun to fight back.<br><br>Finally, Robin goes at it solo in the so-called Puzzle stages. Viewed from the top, Robin must navigate a labyrinth of rooms and find the exit. Crates block the way that have to be moved in the correct order to free the path. Passwords and key cards must be found to open barriers. To gain access to areas behind holes that are too small to pass through, a remote-controlled robot called the Batcrawler can be used. These stages also have enemies to be defeated.<br><br>Once the game has been finished in Story Mode, a password is given out for Advance Mode. Advance Mode features slightly different versions of the original levels with different goals: in the side-scrolling, Puzzle and Batmobile levels, three data disks must be collected and the end of the level reached before a timer runs out. In the Batplane levels, the Joker has placed three "Pyro toys", which have to be destroyed, again before a timer runs out.

There are collectibles in each level, called Bit Beasts, and each level has a par time to beat. Of course, you're controlling a top, not a marble, and so you have a spin gauge.

Set on the island of Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka race who also enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used.<br><br>The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a TOA of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each TOA has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific TOA guise, but in the Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. TOAs can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually.<br><br>TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. The orbs are chased off when they take too much damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons can be customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do double damage. Additional attacks are provided through elemental runes, which provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a lightning shield, smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire blast.<br><br>By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are revealed, providing health and bonus points. The TOAs also need to use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the performance or specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few can only be found in the Free Play mode.<br><br>Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. They allow to play as a golden TOA or to obtain a new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant invincibility or one-shot kills.

Description=BookWorm is a combination of Scrabble and Bejeweled, in which you create words by selecting letters from adjacent tiles. Completed words are converted to points and removed from the board. New tiles fall in from the top to fill in the empty tile positions. Watch out for fiery letter tiles that will burn through your other tiles one at a time. Creating longer words will stave off burning tiles and generate bonus tiles as well. Words containing bonus tiles are worth more points.<br><br>The dictionary in this deluxe version is robust, containing over 150,000 words from three to twelve letters long. The Deluxe version adds an Action Game, new bonus gem tiles, automatic saved games, many word definitions, and a high score Hall of Fame maintained locally and, optionally, on the Internet.

Description=Boundish is a series of five different two player games, mostly based around the very first video game ever made, Pong.  You can choose to play these games either versus a CPU opponent, or head-to-head against another player.  Player one is always red, and player two is always blue.  The games are:<br><br>Pool Flower<br>Two players bounce a ball left and right between each other, aiming to get it past the opposing player to score a point.  Players can move up and down the entirety of the screen, as well as forward and back about a third of the screen.  Circles of varying size float around the screen - if these are hit, they turn the same color as the last player who hit the ball away.<br><br>Box Juggling<br>The odd game out of the bunch - this game is instead based on Nintendo's very first Game & Watch game, Ball.  One player walks left and right at the bottom of the screen, keeping a box in the air.  If the box hits the ground, it's game over.  Pressing A makes the player push the box back in the air - if the player hits the box with their head, it still counts as a hit, but the player is briefly stunned.  Power ups and additional boxes appear as the game progresses to keep things different.<br><br>Power Slider<br>Two players stand around the edge of a binocular-shaped field.  They bounce a puck between each other, and each time it bounces, it leaves a hole in the playfield.  Players can hold the A Button and let it go just as the puck approaches them to perform a power shot.  Players hug their circular side of the playfield to take shots at the puck.<br><br>Human League<br>The screen is divided into two sides, and two human-shaped paddles are on each side.  The game plays somewhat like doubles tennis, in that if the first player misses the ball, the second player has a chance to recover it.  Using Up and Down moves both players (the second player moves more slowly), while Left and Right moves the player closer to the net only.  Pressing A while holding Up or Down will make the outer player make a dash for the corner in that direction.<br><br>Wild Go Round<br>This game has the two players rotating around a vinyl record.  The goal is to get the opponent to drop the ball off the record.  Each time a player hits the ball, the record rotates, and the label changes color.  If the label is the same color as your player, you will score a point.  The record's rotation also affects the movement of the ball.

Description=Championship Manager Quiz is the unexpected result of developer Sports Interactive looking to branch out from their successful football management series called, funnily enough, Championship Manager. <br><br>If you think a quiz game may not be the best use of their skills then think again. This isn't just a collection of thousands of football trivia questions with points scored for each correct answer - that would be too simple. The football fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge but also the rules and tactics involved in the sport too. <br><br>The quiz is played out like a real game of football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams and get to pick who you want to play as at the start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as the questions will really probe your love for the club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball around the field by answering questions correctly. Below the shirt of each player are question categories. Pass the ball to that player and answer the question correctly to keep possession. Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a striker, answer the question correctly and you've scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is irrelevant; the game is decided on who scores the most goals. <br><br>There are over 11,000 questions so you shouldn't see many being repeated often - in comparison, last year's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game only contained 1,000! The questions cover a broad range of football knowledge too, from domestic to international, third division to golden boot winners. There are five different modes of play, including penalty shoot out, pub quiz where more than two can play and keepy-uppy where you've got to answer correctly for as long as possible.

Arcade: shoot a specific number of chickens to move on to the next level. There is no time limit and the enemies attack by throwing eggs towards the screen. There is no time limit and when Chicken Bill's 100 points are depleted, the game is over.<br><br>2. Classic: the same gameplay as Arcade, requiring a certain number of chickens to be shot, but now with a time limit added. Certain chickens carry time packages, providing time bonuses.<br><br>3. Multiplayer: score more points than your opponent in a set amount of time.<br><br>There are three difficulty levels and support for high scores (not saved after powering off). At the end of each level, statistics are shown based on the shots fired, hits, accuracy, general score, and energy or time remaining. There are different types of weapons (pistol, shotgun, uzi, machine gun, laster, flame thrower and bombs) and a limited amount of ammo. During gameplay, accuracy is shown through a thermometer on the screen. When it rises to the top, all hits are awarded with double points.

Description=The CIMA aliens feed on humankind hopes and dreams. They build elaborate mazes and trap people inside them as a way of producing their food. A force called "Gate Guardians" was created to protect the population from this menace. Three Guardians were on a train delivering settlers to a distant station, when suddenly a portal for another dimension appeared and transported everyone to a strange moon-like place. The Guardians must find the way home and bring back safely every passenger.<br><br>CIMA: The Enemy is a RPG with strategic elements. Although labeled a RPG, the game doesn't have the usual trappings of the genre: there is no levelling up, nor any form of currency or shops to buy equipment. Instead, the game is focused on the management of a huge party of characters (16 by the end of the game). The main objective is to guide these civilians on mazes, using their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Each character has a special trait that can be used to the player's advantage (a medic that concots health potions, a blacksmith that upgrades armor and weapons, etc).<br><br>Pressing the R button brings up a cross with the party portraits at each point and a multicolor cross on the middle. The characters can be individually guided by selecting their portraits or moved in groups by selecting the multicolor cross. Three way-points can be set for easier manouvering (almost a necessity, the characters have a tendency to get stuck on corners and walls). The groups to be moved can be selected by hitting the L button (a cross with numbered tents at each point appears).<br><br>One crucial gameplay aspect is the amount of trust the party members have on their Guardians. Each character has a gauge that shows the amount of trust they have. This number increases and decreases according to actions within the game. If a character is hurt his/her trust decreases, and a red heart with an arrow pointing downwards appears over his/her head. Likewise, if a character sees a guardian slaying a monster the opposite effect happens, and a green heart with an upwards arrow appears over his/her head. Trust is important because the characters only cooperate with the Guardians when they have the right amount of it.<br><br>Using the START button brings up a cross with the following functions:<br><br>? The south point has a wrench icon. It accesses the game options menu that can save the game (at any time), quit it or change the text speed.<br><br>? The north point has a face with a speech ballon icon. It is the dialogue screen, where the characters speak about the situation and how they are feeling.<br><br>? The middle of the cross has a sword and a potion icon. It is the inventory screen, where potions and other items can be equipped on a cross. The main character's inventory cross can be accessed in-game by pressing the A button. The other characters use items automatically when needed (they don't equip them automatically, though).<br><br>? The east point has a stylized file of people icon. This is the group screen, where characters can be organized in groups for easier management and manouvering.<br><br>? The west point has a stylized body and heart icon. It is the statistics screen, where the player can check what weapons, stats and armor each character has.<br><br>The top-left of the main game screen shows the health points bar of the main character. Below that occasionally is shown a health bar of any near party member being attacked. When a party character is about to expire, a jewel is displayed besides the main character's health bar, and an alarm sound is played. Death of any party member ends the game instantaneously.

Description=Coloris is a simple puzzle game for the Game Boy Advance.  The object of the game is to match three or more of the same colored tiles either horizontally or vertically.  You can change the color of a tile by selecting it with the cursor, then pressing A.  This will make the selected tile closer to the color of the cursor (for example, if you select a red tile when the cursor is blue, the red tile will become purple).  There are also two special tiles which can be cleared: one clears all tiles on-screen of one color; the other clears all tiles in an X shape starting from the power up tile.<br><br>There are two modes of play available in Coloris.  The first is Clear Mode.  In this mode, you're aiming to fill the gauge at the top of the screen.  You can do this by clearing tiles.  However, if you are too slow to clear tiles, they will begin to turn gray.  When there are gray tiles on the screen, the gauge cannot be filled.  Gray tiles can be removed by clearing nearby colored tiles.<br><br>The second mode of play in Coloris is Score Mode.  Score Mode cannot be cleared - the aim of this mode is to get as high a score as possible, by clearing as many tiles as you can.  Score Mode ends when all of your tiles turn gray.

Description=CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.<br><br>The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections: when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top.<br><br>The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided  (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).

Description=CT Special Forces: Back to Hell is the sequel to CT Special Forces and the story picks up right where the last game ended. Having destroyed the terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are going back to do training missions, but more and more reports about new terror threats keep popping up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or maybe Network is back for a second round? It's up to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of terrorism once again!<br><br>The game plays in 5 different game modes. The majority is made up of side scrolling platform action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, where you pick up various weapons, grenades and even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every now and then you'll come across a wooden sign with a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game into first person view, where you have to shoot terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you'll find a parachute pack, and you'll have to play a mini game where you have to make two meters align to make a drop successfully with your parachute.<br><br>There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One is a top down shoot'em up, where you have to bomb land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, where you have to save hostages and bring them to your base, while gunning down enemies across the stage.

Description=Dialhex is a simple puzzle game for the Game Boy Advance.  While it looks similar to Hexic on the surface, it is actually quite different.  The play field for Dialhex is a large hexagonal bin.  Triangles of different colors fall from the top of the bin, and react to gravity to fall to the bottom-most centre of the bin.  Using the Control Pad, players can move a hexagonal cursor around the bin, and rotate any of the triangles around by using L or R.  To clear the bin, players must rotate the triangles to fit six triangles of the same color together.  The hexagon then disappears, and any remaining triangles fall to the centre of the pile.<br><br>Dialhex has two special triangles that can help you as you play.  If you slot a white flashing triangle into your colored hexagon, when the hexagon clears, it will also clear all triangles in the bin of the same color.  If you slot a black flashing triangle into your hexagon, when the hexagon clears, a beam of light will cut through the bin, and assorted triangles will pour through the bottom of the bin for a short period of time.<br><br>Dialhex features two modes of play.  The first mode is Solo - in this mode, you start with two different types of colored triangles pouring into the bin.  Your aim is to complete six hexagons of each color - when you do this, a new color will be added to the bin, and so on.<br><br>In Endless mode, you aim for the highest score possible.  There is no real goal in this mode except to survive.  In both modes, the game is over if your bin fills entirely to the top.

Description=The Digimon prove themselves to be versatile creatures as they hop in cars and compete against each other in this kart-style racing game.<br><br>The third Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, Digimon Racing has all the features you'd expect out of a racing game. There's a good variety of colorful and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, including a wide variety of themes such as jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, and gravel-covered hills), nearly a dozen Digimon to pick from and unlock, and several gameplay modes ranging from cup races to time trials. A handful of boss races round out the action, and provide a challenge for players.<br><br>The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded versions of themselves. Once you've digivolved, you can use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and keep your own Digimon ahead of the others.<br><br>While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes and characters, Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer arena. Since it includes support for up to four players using the link cable or wireless adapter, the multiplayer experience is the real highlight of the game.

Description=Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.<br><br>Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

Description=Released in the arcades in 1983, Donkey Kong 3 is the third of the "Donkey Kong" arcade game series, changing the format to more of an action-shooter than a platform game. <br><br>As Stanley the Bugman, players are positioned under Donkey Kong, who has taken over a multi-level greenhouse.  Stanley's goal is to remove Donkey Kong from the greenhouse, but the big ape isn't willing to leave without a fight.<br><br>Donkey Kong will agitate two beehives that are close to him to send down a swarm of angry Buzzbees, Beespies and destructive Queen Bees toward Stanley.  These insects, as well as caterpillars which creep down nearby vines are intent on destroying the flowers below Stanley.  Donkey Kong will also send down projectiles himself in an attempt to stop Stanley's attacks.  Stanley must jump between the levels and use his bugspray to repel the insects, and send Donkey Kong into the next area of the greenhouse.<br><br>Once Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough, a can of super bugspray will become available, allowing a larger shooting radius, and is able to send Donkey Kong up the vines faster.<br><br>Once Donkey Kong is sent through the three levels of the greenhouse, Donkey Kong will end up with a beehive on his head, and the levels start all over again.

Description=King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.<br><br>Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.<br><br>The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.

Description=The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.<br><br>id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.<br><br>The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be <br>pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.<br><br>DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.<br><br>Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.<br><br>DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.<br><br>DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.<br><br>The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.<br><br>DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in <br>a random location after being killed.

It's your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth.<br><br>Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys.

Description=Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China,  it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.<br><br>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.

Also, whereas the Japanese version featured characters that were geared towards anime and had larger heads, this version's characters are more realistically designed to look like actual people instead.  It also features the ability to allow four friends to play against each other using the Game Boy Link Cable.

The game content is exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline: the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to protect America's "interests" in the region.<br><br>The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco's two following GBA flight sims, 2004's Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007's F24 Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game's engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a landing strip.

Description=Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it's not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. <br>The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).<br><br>The main gameplay change was the addition of "First Touch" controls. By performing one of the "trick" moves before the player gets possession of the ball it's possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the "Off The Ball" controls (allows the control of players that aren't in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged.<br><br>Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums.<br><br>As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11'000 real footballers.

But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...<br><br>This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.<br><br>The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.

People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".<br><br>But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...<br><br>The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.<br><br>The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.

Final Fantasy I allows players to build their party out of six possible classes, with varying spells and stats.

The player takes on the role of Prince Ephraim and his sister Princess Erika, two of the few survivors of Grado's attack, following their different paths through the story. <br><br>Gameplay in Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is similar to its predecessors or the Advance Wars games. The player controls several different units in tactical turn-based battles. <br><br>There are many different classes ranging from knights, thieves and archers to paladins, wyvern riders, great knights and more. As in RPGs, units receive experience points for their actions and may choose to upgrade to a different class once they reach a high enough level.<br><br>A key element in Fire Emblem's gameplay are the three different types of weapons and magic. One type of weapon or magic is always strong against one, and weak against another type.<br><br>During battles, it is also possible to visit stores to buy equipment, or houses to gain hints.<br><br>Sometimes neutral units will also participate in battle. They can be convinced to join the player's army if the right person talks to them.<br><br>Unlike most similar games, when a unit dies in battle it is impossible to revive it.

Description=Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle. <br><br>Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent's fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players.<br><br>The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score.<br><br>The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.

Description=A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. <br><br>This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.<br><br>There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. <br><br>Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.<br><br>While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.

Description=Set in Suikoden universe, the game follows closely the story of  Suikoden II. The hero is a young member of the Unicorn Brigade of the Highland Army. One night, your camp is attacked. You and your best friend Jowy escape, and the fate takes you into different directions, when you get involved in a war between several nations.<br><br>Unlike "mainstream" Suikoden games, this is a card RPG. Most of the game is spent playing a special card game with your opponents. The complex card game is not unlike a strategy battle: you have three types of cards, some of which take you to a specific "mission" (you open the game with such cards), while others represent various characters with different strengths and weaknesses. You can acquire cards in shops, get them from your opponents, and also look for them in randomly generated dungeons.

When this is complete, the level will end, and you will be shown that the missing blocks created a picture.<br><br>The game has a series of levels, each with their own set of puzzles.  There is a main goal for each level.  In one, ducks in spiky eggshells have stolen a tap handle, and a thirsty athlete needs a drink of water.  You need to solve a set amount of puzzles before you can break the last puzzle in the stage open, solve it, and reclaim the item needed to help the person or people for that stage.<br><br>Multiplayer mode features the same basic mechanics as single player, except that the puzzles are extremely simplified (usually not requiring more than four blocks to fill).

Description=The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second Harry Potter book and movie is, like its predecessor, an action adventure, this time with an isometric perspective.<br><br>In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges.<br> These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.<br><br>As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.<br><br>Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.

It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies.<br><br>Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can also collect band-aid to restore your health, extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences (playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D visuals from the film.

Description=Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin and his family see an advertisement for the circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late, and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search across the land for his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way through fairly narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the Heririn is destroyed, and you must start the stage again.<br><br>Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters, which take the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these mini-games are then added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three friends using only one cart.<br><br>The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them are fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory match game.

They have received a strange letter from an anonymous sender, and are about to discuss it during their meeting in a park, when they suddenly become unconscious... When the two wake up, they find themselves in a strange world, populated by characters from various works by  Go Nagai. At first, they meet Akira from Devilman and Cutey Honey from the  eponymous manga. At that point, the player can choose to follow either of them as the main protagonist; the best friend will then leave with the other character.

Description=Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link...<br><br>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action adventure game (similar to the original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance.  Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule.  Unlike turn-based RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by pressing a button, or can spin the sword around you for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged.<br><br>Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon's particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link's latest new ability.  The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level's particular item.<br><br>Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four 'pieces of heart'; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game.  Some of Link's items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots.  After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make your way past previously impassable obstacles.<br><br>The Game Boy Advance version of the game also includes a special extra dungeon.  In addition to this, there is the first multiplayer Zelda game ever: Four Swords.  In this game puzzles are based around co-operation with other players - for example, picking up an enemy and throwing it at another player which allows its weak point to be hit, or a boss which only shows the weak point you can hit on an opponent's screen.  However, the game also contains an element of competitiveness - whoever gains the most rupees at the end of the level wins a bonus medal.  Collect enough of these and you can unlock a special quest in A Link to the Past.

Description=In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.<br><br>The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.<br><br>The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. <br><br>Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. <br><br>There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. <br><br>To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. <br><br>If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. <br><br>The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.

On his travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a Minish so that he can meet with them.  With his newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom from Vaati's menace.<br><br>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down action adventure game that tells the origins of the evil Vaati from Four Swords.  Players take on the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and progress through various obstacles.  Items such as the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, items, and propel Link.  Link can also shrink down to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the talking cap.<br><br>The Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of shrinking to make familiar territory new and different.  Puddles become huge rivers, baby chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies become deadly bosses at Minish size.  Link can also trade items called "Kinstones" with people in the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone are joined together, new areas open up, treasure chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards are given to Link.

Description=Focused on the original trilogy of the Star Wars universe (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of Jedi), the sequel to LEGO Star Wars brings some innovations over the first title. <br><br>During the story mode, the player is joined on-screen by two other characters, and can change between them to use their specific skills to proceed. Characters share a life bar of four hearts, with the rate of depletion changing according to each character (a stormtrooper will lose three hearts when hit by a blaster, Vader will take two or three hits before losing one). If a support character is "dismantled" by attacks, there's no problem, but letting that happen to the controlled character means a loss of stud points (the game currency), as well as a drop on the "Super Kit" gauge, which replaces the Jedi rank evaluation of the previous titles. <br><br>Gameplay has been changed to accommodate the lack of lightsaber battles in the later episodes, and so blasters are a lot more effective and fire faster, but have lost their "charge" mode. New flight missions are also included. These are similar to previous Star Wars games, like Return of the Jedi, and allow the player to attack both Death Stars, skim the surface of the forest moon of Endor in a Speeder, escape from an asteroid field with the Millennium Falcon, or draw wires around the legs of Imperial walkers in Hoth.<br><br>There are three major character classes: droids (unable to fight, but the only ones capable of opening most regular doors during story mode), Jedi (melee fighters capable of interacting with larger objects to uncover hidden studs and with different Jedi powers) and Blaster users, which can fire at an enemy from a distance, as well as assemble smaller objects (like short bridges or door switches).<br><br>Gameplay remains a light jump-and-slash isometric game, with the goal being usually to go from point A to B, while pulling levers somewhere in the level. Like in the first game, the game can not be entirely completed without playing in Free Mode (a near perfect run in Story mode will only complete around 50% of the game), as many doors can only be opened, or even reached, by using the unique special abilities of one of the 36 unlockable characters. <br><br>To acquire characters for Free Play, the player now needs to accomplish three things: earn enough credits (the value of each stud was increased 10 fold), complete a level (to unlock playable characters such as the level variation of Luke or Leia), and get all "mini kits" (which replace the "Death Star Plans" of the prequel). Characters that can be unlocked include enemies, such as the Tusken Raider or Stormtroopers, or heroic characters, like Yoda. There are also additional items to be bought, including music, palette swaps, new game modes, lightsaber colours and hints.

Description=Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.<br><br>Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three chapters (each with over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children's fortune.<br><br>Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an "apple chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.<br><br>The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all the game's quirky secrets.

Previously uninterested in Homecoming, Lizzie suddenly develops a fierce determination to show up Kate and swipe the crown from her clutches.<br><br>Homecoming Havoc plays somewhat like Nintendo's Wario Ware, in that players must make their way through a series of short mini-games rapidly thrown at you one after the other.  While each of Wario Ware's stages has a theme, each of Homecoming Havoc's minigames in the ten stages are randomly selected from the game's minigame library.<br><br>As players progress through the minigames, they earn points and tokens.  Tokens can be used to purchase cards that will allow you to skip a particular type of minigame if you fail it.  At the end of each set of ten minigames, there is a Dance Competition.  In this game, players must input the correct arrow sequence using the Control Pad as the arrows pass along the screen.

Description=The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age for the Game Boy Advance encompasses the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, but does so in a unique turn-based strategy formula.<br><br>Unlike the console versions, the Game Boy Advance version gives players the option of playing the heroes from the trilogy, selecting their commander from the likes of Aragorn and Gandalf, or even using the evil forces of Mordor and choosing the Witch-king or Saruman.<br><br>From there, the player experiences over 30 battle scenarios, ranging from the well-known battles of the film (Helm's Deep and the Pelennor Fields), small skirmishes (Amon Hen and Osgiliath), and even some more battles just hinted at in the movies (Isildur's ambush, Theodred's death at the fords of the River Isen).<br><br>In each battle, players choose their companions (again, classic characters from the films such as Legolas and Gimli are available, along with bad guys like Wormtongue and Gorbag), and face off against the foe with dozens of troops, including orcs, trolls, Gondorians, Riders of Rohan, Easterlings, Mumakil, and dozens more.<br><br>Unlike other turn-based games, you can't move all of your units each turn. Rather, the board is divided into three "flanks," and your hero in each flank generates the command points you use to move units in that flank. Thus, good leaders like Aragorn may have a lot of command points to give his flank (3-4 is typical), while Gimli may have less, but be a better warrior to make up for it.<br><br>After a battle, you can upgrade your heroes with equipment and special skills, and move onward to conquer the next area of Middle-earth.

The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.<br><br>A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.<br><br>Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.<br><br>Some educational content has also been included.

Description=The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in.<br><br>The main single-player experience involves traveling across "Shroom City," which is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles.  You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.<br><br>You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges.  Most quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game.  By completing these quests, you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.<br><br>The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the "Mushroom Challenges" that occur rather often.  After completing your session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode.<br><br>There are also two additional modes available, "Party Land," where you can play special duel mini-games with a friend, and "Challenge Land," where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.<br><br>Finally, there is also a feature called the "Bonus Board."  You can play with a board that is included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.

Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a "Time Attack" mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.

However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.

Description=Although the name implies you're going to catch monsters, Monster! Bass Fishing is a normal fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish including various bass, northern pike, catfish, and more.  The "monster" part is that you get bonus points for catching monster-sized fish.<br><br>The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge or Free Fish.  In Free Fish, you can fish in any location that is unlocked for as long as you like.  In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a specific location to fish at.<br><br>When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your boat to any place on the map.  However, this does take time and may not always be in your best interest in the Challenge mode.  You can then either start casting, or you can change your lure first.<br><br>Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting movements.  When a fish strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get away.  If you let the line get too tight, the line will break and you'll lose the fish then as well.  Now just reel it in and see what you caught.<br><br>The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is seen.  Note that this finder is not always accurate.<br><br>Statistics for the game are very nice.  You can see a nice picture of your fish that you catch along with the size of it.  The top 6 can then be saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time.  Your tournament scores will be based on weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3 largest fish that round).  Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations and let you progress to a new location for the next tournament.  It will also get you a nice trophy.

The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments.

Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement age.<br><br>There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced.

Description=The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare. <br><br>Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to "dash", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters). <br><br>There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP meters"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as "DP"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects. <br><br>There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.

Description=Motocross Challenge is a 2D side-scrolling motorcycle game combining regular racing and tricks. The game can only be played through an emulator or a GBA flashcard but is not strictly homebrew. It is a game made by a commercial developer, but when the project was cancelled by two publishers, they decided to release the game for free. The game can also be ordered on a cartridge from the developer's website. In 2010 it was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release.<br><br>The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay seems inspired by Motocross Maniacs. The game offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an unlocked bike and track to practise) and Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of events in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock (time-based), Trick Attack (points-based) and World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all courses are finished, the final event, MXC Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided over different trees and completing certain courses unlocks new tracks or one of the 8 available bikes. The bikes have different statistics based on speed, handling, acceleration, height, boost and suspension.<br><br>Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When the bike accelerates, the front wheel leaves the ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging the d-pad. Up and down on the d-pad is used to switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through the L-button) involve balance and constant correcting is needed. Next to accelerating, braking and tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a limited amount is offered, but it constantly regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to gain extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain extra air time. The full amount of boost should never be used or let maxed out, as too little or too much slows the bike down. While in the air, using a combination of the L-button and the d-pad, players can perform tricks such as superman, nac-nac of backflip. By completing Trick Attack events, new tricks can be unlocked.<br><br>There are different types of tracks, set on a beach, an arena, downtown, in the snow, in a forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain a series of jumps but also areas that slow down the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen shows the current position of the player (in World Tour), the current location on the track along with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat the Clock), the current lap (in World Tour), the boost meter and the amount of points for a trick, and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick Attack). The game supports passwords to save and restore the player's progress.

Description=Naruto: Ninja Council is another game that was taken from a famous Japanese anime series and is also the first installment of the Ninja Council series. <br><br>It's a side scrolling, action oriented game with two modes to choose - Story mode and Free mode - and two playable characters. The story of Ninja Council starts from the survival exam and ends with Orochimarus attack at the Hidden Konoha Village. Apart from that there are no actual events between that - that take place on the anime although there are fights with certain characters that do like the fight with Haku and Orochimaru.<br><br>The characters that are available are Naruto and Sasuke. When you start a new game at the beginning of each stage Kakashi sensei appears to give you hints about the controls and other useful staff like a boss weak point or attack patterns. There are also hidden characters you can find who can restore your health when you run out of life. Stages have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete. At the end of each stage there is a boss fight and the timer resets at 5 minutes in which you have to win the battle in order to advance the game and be able to save your progress.<br><br>The two available characters - Naruto and Sasuke - can both use the same combo hits and weapons that can be picked up in each stage like shuriken and kunai. Every second stage the player will also find scrolls that contain elemental power ups like the Lightning Style Scroll that can be used either for attacking opponents or for progressing in the game. Apart from that each one has a set of three unique special attacks that can be used but only if you have sufficient amount of chakra.

Description=This is the second Naruto title for the Ninja Council series and follows the adventures of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura as they try to pass the Chunin Exam in a total of seven stages.<br><br>Unlike the first title you can now control three characters by changing them anytime you want inside the game. Each one has unique sequences of punches and kicks and can use 3 special techniques with varying results from one character to another. The shuriken, kunai and fuma from the first game are still here although this time one hit is enough to dispatch an enemy. Along the stages you can also find summoning scrolls and use them in fights to call Kakashi, Choji and others to attack the enemies. Another addition to the gameplay is the Teleport move which as the name implies allows you to teleport near or behind an enemy to attack him or simply dodge his attacks. At parts of each stage you may be given certain objectives such as to defeat all the enemies or finish the stage within a time limit and parameters like the use of only one character. At the end of each stage you get a grade depending on how many enemies you killed, how fast you finished the stage, how many characters you are left and how many leaves you have collected. At the end of the game these grades will be accumulated to decide your final rank.<br><br>The game also features two additional modes  the Co-op Mode and the Vs. Mode but you need the link cable for that.

The sword is automatically used when you are close enough to an enemy, and it can also be used to deflect enemy shurikens.

You must shift the food into the holes using the cursor before time runs out, and if you do so, the food is served.  Every five rounds, you get a difficult challenge where there is only a set path to move around.<br><br>The second game has you guiding a little white blob with legs.  You cannot directly control him, but you can use your cursor to rotate paths in front of him to safely get him to the finish line.  You can also make him run by holding the R Button.<br><br>The final, and most in-depth game, shows an 8x8 grid of coloured number blocks, from three to six.  Line up three 'threes', and they turn into fours, line up four 'fours', and they turn into fives, line up five 'fives', and they turn into sixes, and line  up six 'sixes', and they disappear.  You can line the blocks up either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.  You can also move other blocks around while numbers are changing to set off massive combos.

The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It's about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth. <br><br>The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the hunters!

Description=Take control of a small moon and consume all in your path!  Orbital is an action game where you pilot a moon in outer space.  Your goal is to have the sun orbiting around your small planet.  Before you can do that, however, you'll need to become big enough.  You can increase the size of your moon by engulfing planets and satellites that are smaller than your own.  If you try to run into anything larger than yourself (or the sun), you'll crash and lose a life.  Once you've reached a large enough size, the sun will turn yellow, and you'll be able to collect it by navigating close enough to it to snare it in your moon's orbit.<br><br>Control for Orbital is very simple.  By pressing the A Button, you'll attract to the nearest planet.  By pressing the B Button, you'll repel away from it.  By using a combination of these simple controls, you'll be able to weave in and out of other planets, dodging the dangerous ones and collecting the smaller ones.  You can also collect smaller planets around your own as satellites for bonus points.  To do this, you must navigate close enough to the planet to attract it, but not run into it.  You can also collect the bonus moon that appears in this manner for a special bonus.

Description=The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as "Far East of Eden". You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries. <br><br>The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.

Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.<br><br>Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire. <br><br>The game is divided into levels, each one of which can be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.

Description=The wedding anniversary for Penny Proud's parents is close, and that means its time to get them a present!  Penny made something herself, but her friends said that she should get them a T.H.A.N.G.(or Total Home Automated Necessity Gizmo) instead.  It's very expensive, but much cheaper if you buy it in pieces and self-assemble it.  So Penny needs to spend time working jobs to get enough money to buy it.<br><br>The video game for The Proud Family can best be described as a side-scrolling adventure game.  Players navigate through Penny's neighborhood, being informed of odd jobs that Penny can take to earn money.  Anything from picking up litter to working at the local Pizza Parlor, to finding neighbors' lost dogs on the streets.  Once Penny has earned enough money for a T.H.A.N.G. part, she can go to the store to buy it, and then the next chapter begins.<br><br>The game also has mini-games which are based around Penny's official 'jobs' that she receives.  For example, she works for her dad at his factory, combining various snacks to please three different judges.  Another mini-game has Penny competing in a dance-off.  And at Chez Wizard, she has to take up a waitress job, where she greets and seats customers, takes their orders, delivers their food, takes the payment, and clears the dirty dishes.  On top of this, it all has to be done quickly to satisfy the customers!<br><br>Certain areas in the game also present themselves as photo opportunities.  If Penny stands close enough to a star marker and presses the R Button, she'll get a photo of one of the characters from the show that will be stored in her photo album.  If she's not close enough, she'll just get a fuzzy photo of a UFO instead.

Description=In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. <br><br>You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.<br><br>You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.<br><br>Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. <br><br>Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.<br><br>Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.

Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.<br><br>With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).<br><br>The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.

The developer, Codo Technologies, is composed of staff who have worked on games such as Laser Squad Nemesis, X-Com, and the original Laser Squad and Rebelstar Raiders. R:TC offers a similar style of play, and it may appeal to fans those titles and turn-based strategy games.<br><br>In Rebelstar: TC, players take control of a squad of 6 soldiers in a series of battles against an alien oppressor. The main character is Jorel, a young recruit to the rebel cause against the antagonist Arelian species. As the game and story progresses, Jorel will rise up the ranks to lead and recruit additional characters, each with a particular specialization of skills. In addition to fighting the Arelians, players will also do battle with the brutish shock troops of the Zorn, the insect-like Fraylar, and a variety of lesser creatures and robots. <br><br>Gameplay revolves around the player completing a series of battles in order to progress the plot. Prior to the start of most missions, players must select the characters that will participate in the battle and equip them appropriately. Rebelstar: TC offers a wide range of weapons, including melee, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, and heavy weapons. Firearms may also offer different firing modes, such as single shot, limited burst fire, and full automatic. Other equipment include different types of body armor, grenades, power cells, and medical kits. Characters have a number of statistics that govern their movement, speed, weapon use, stealth, and other skills. As the game proceeds and characters perform various actions, they gain experience points and level up. Each level up provides an opportunity for the player to add skill points to a chosen skill. The greater the skill rating, the better the character can perform or utilize weapons and equipment.<br><br>The battles themselves are turn-based in nature, with the player moving and performing actions with his characters, then the enemy side doing the same once the player is done. Each character has a pool of "Action Points" to spend on actions during a turn. A character can thus perform a series of actions until he or she runs out of points. These action points refill at the beginning of the player's next turn. Players can also spend all of the character's points to place him on "Overwatch." On this mode, a character will spend his stored action points on firing on any enemy that comes into his view, which is useful if you wish to have a character cover certain areas. Battles also take into account line of sight, terrain deformation (ie: walls blown up by explosives), and morale. All of these features give quite a number of tactical options and considerations to the game.

Description=Road Rash: Jailbreak for the GBA features the classic Road Rash gameplay; motorcycle racing on busy streets, with dirty tricks both allowed and expected. Several game modes are included. Wild Race is a basic race, just you versus several computer bikers in a race to the finish line. Use your fists or items you find along the way to knock opponents off their bike and into the hands of law enforcement. Cop Patrol puts you into the shoes of Marshall Lee, to take down those no-good motorcycling thugs. Time Attack is pure racing; just you, the road, and a ticking clock. Survival mode doesn't allow you to restart a race if you lose, so you'll need to complete all races on the first try. Finally, a 2-player mode is included.<br><br>Three different characters are included, each with distinct strengths and a special weapon. Between races, you can upgrade your chosen character. Saving is possible through passwords, and both your current upgrades and unlocked tracks will be remembered.

In this game, the player does not control Lan  instead, you play as yourself.  Upon the game's first play, you are prompted to enter details such as date, time, your age and occupation.  You can then choose your Net Navi (initially available for selection are Mega Man, Roll, GutsMan and NumberMan).<br><br>Unlike previous Battle Network games, you do not directly control your Net Navi.  Instead, you can tell your Navi which enemy they should attack, as well as their attacking distance, and they will perform according to your directions.  You can also select to use  Battle Chips (from three which are randomly selected from your folder) by using the Control Pad to select the chip described at the bottom of the screen, then pressing A to use it.<br><br>The game also supports a peripheral created specifically for the game, called the Battle Chip Gate. This peripheral plugs into your Game Boy Advance, and allows the player to send their Navi Battle Chips during battle, much like Lan does in the Mega Man NT Warrior anime.  You can get additional Battle Chips when you purchase assorted Mega Man Battle Network toys, such as character figures.

Description=When bounty hunter Jenosa Arma takes on a mission to investigate Planet Inos, a research center investigating an alien lifeform called Scurge, she gets more than she bargained for.  While in orbit around the planet, she is attacked and quickly infected with the Scurge herself.  Jenosa has no alternative but to land onto Inos, to investigate the Scurge and find a cure.<br><br>Scurge: Hive is an action game with some similarities in storyline to Nintendo's Metroid series.  However, the game itself is significantly different from Metroid. As Jenosa, players must blast their way through Planet Inos while trying to constantly contain their own infection.  While progressing through the game, Jenosa's 'infection meter' slowly increases (faster if she is standing on red patches of Scurge) - the meter can only be reduced back to 1% by using a Decontamination Platform, which also acts as a save point.  Failing to temporarily cure Jenosa of the Scurge results in rapid depletion of life as the virus takes over, so players must complete mission objectives quickly!<br><br>Jenosa can earn experience as she blasts infected life forms; this experience will upgrade her firepower and health.  Better weaponry can be found, as well as gadgets which help Jenosa access new areas.  Some weapons are twice as effective on particular opponents; inversely, they are ineffective against other enemy types.  It's up to you to figure out the best weapon for the right situation.

It is once again up to Django to clean up this mess, in order to achieve one of  four possible endings.<br><br>As in its two predecessors the striking feature is once again the solar sensor that is implemented in the cartridge. Its main purpose is to use sunlight as ammo for the solar gun "Gun del Sol", making its comeback from the first game. Gameplay changes depending on if the game is played in the sun and how intense the sunlight is. For example, water disappears, light shines through the ceiling of dungeons or hidden passages become visible once the solar sensor detects sunlight.<br><br>Aside for the aforementioned sunlight elements, the gameplay consists mainly of classic Zelda-like puzzle solving and a few stealth-action elements. For the first time in the series the game includes arcade-like driving sequences on a motorbike, which can be upgraded with various parts, improving its performance. By frequently hitting enemies the Trance gauge can be filled, allowing the player to transform into either Sol Django or Black Django, giving him special attacks. The motorbike mini-game can be played competitively with two players.

You can take up to twelve different members of your Shining Force into battle. There are many different classes ranging from fighters and magicians to healers, knights, monks, ninjas and many more. In-between battles you can explore various towns to buy new weapons and items or chat with the townsfolk. There are also a number of secret characters and items to be discovered.<br><br>Shining Force's gameplay has also seen some changes. The interface has been slightly simplified and you can now organize your units before battles. During battles, it is now possible to view upcoming turns, which makes it much easier to plan your next steps. To make the battles more interesting, even for fans of the original, you receive certain bonuses (usually money or a weapon) for completing battles in a set number of turns. Finally, a card-collecting side-quest has been added. Cards can have various effects in battle and one character is able to transform into the cards that you have found.

You can play the game as either Jin or Akira (the choice will influence the storyline). The battles are now a mixture between turn-based and real time style: enemies will perform a move even if you wait and do nothing, so quick thinking is necessary for combat. After an enemy is defeated, you can talk to it and try to persuade it to join your party. Demons will then fight for you, controlled as playable characters. Like in "mature" Megami Tensei games, you can fuse two demons to create a more powerful one.

Description=Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. The game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour.<br><br>When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level. When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is Game Over.<br><br>There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through one level from each difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls among the layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.

Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. <br><br>Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. <br><br>The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

Based on the sound of the car engines and horn honking, you must avoid crashing into other cars by moving into other lanes.  A variation of this is "Sound Chase", where you must try and catch a sound that is running away from you, while simultaneously dodging the cars.  "Sound Cock" has players searching for roosters which can be heard clucking, but cannot be seen.  You'll need to move your character around based on the position of the rooster sounds to try and catch them.

The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.<br><br>You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.

Description=Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.<br><br>You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.<br><br>The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.<br><br>You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.<br><br>A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

Unfortunately the Bogeyman steals the soles of their friends and turns them into stone - of course the two heroes have to get them back. So they visit the Land of Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted house and the lab of a mad scientist (overall 15 stages).<br><br>The player can switch instantly (but limited because it costs crystals which can be found in the levels) between the two characters which is often needed to progress in the game: both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is disguised as a witch, is strong with the ice element, can attack from a range and doesn't take damage from long falls.  Greg on the other hand is the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a super jump. Both have also a special attack which also cost crystals to perform. The gameplay is the usual platforming along with fighting enemies.<br><br>The main difference to the console version is that the whole game is in 2D with different level design and less puzzle elements.

But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.<br><br>Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades .

Description=A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.<br><br>Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.

Description=Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 is a strategy RPG in which players lead a small force of mechs in a fight to save humanity from an alien invasion. The designs of the mechs, pilots, and attacks are heavily influenced by anime. <br><br>The combat system of this game is similar to its predecessor. The player controls multiple mechs and issues commands in a turn-based fashion. Each mech pilot has "spirit commands" that can be used to strengthen a mechs abilities such as its hit or dodge rate. After moving a unit, the player is usually given the option to attack an enemy with an attack from a list. After all of the player's mechs have been moved, the AI gets a turn to move its mechs. If a player mech is attacked, the player has the option of counter-attacking, attempting to evade, or defending.<br><br>Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 does include a few minor changes to the battle system. For one thing, a new attack type (known as a chain attack) allows a unit to strike multiple enemies in a single blow. Also, the AI has been vastly improved.<br><br>The graphics of Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 have been enhanced from the graphics of the original. Attacks from mechs now have a more fluid motion and are generally more interesting to look at.<br><br>The game's story picks up six months after the original Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation left off. Most people on Earth are still trying to recover from the battle with the Aerogaters, but a small remaining faction of the Divine Crusaders is still trying to further their goals. Once again, it's up to the SRX and ATX teams of the EFA to put a stop to their activities and restore order. However, they are soon interupted by two new groups of mysterious enemies: the Einsts and the Inspectors.

Description=Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher.  The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!<br><br>The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use).  After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics.<br><br>Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai.  These weapons are used in their standard attacks.  A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button.  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.

As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.<br><br>The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.<br><br>The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.<br><br>The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.

Description=Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!<br><br>In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.<br><br>Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.<br><br>Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).<br><br>Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).

Description=Torneko: The Last Hope is the sequel to Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon and like that game, stars Torneko (aka<br>Taloon), the merchant from Dragon Warrior IV. Having become rich and properous in the previous game by collecting treasures, Torneko eventually recovered the "Joy Chest" from the very bottom of the dungeon and had it enshrined at his shop. Peace had returned to the town for some time. After awhile, a mysterious stranger arrived and seemed concerned about the Joy Chest being outside the dungeon. At the same time, monsters started reappearing and different parts of the kingdom began turning into "mysterious dungeons". It will be up to middle-aged Torneko, to fight through these strange places and help the king discover what has broken the peace.<br><br>Like other Fushigi no Dungeon games, Torneko: The Last Hope is a dungeon crawler viewed from the overhead. The dungeons are randomly generated. When venturing into dungeons, Torneko will find many items and fight monsters. He can freely move through the dungeons, but each movement or action of his is countered by those of the monsters (if they are present on screen). All actions are made in turns, so despite the illusion of walking and fighting in real time, the game is turn-based. There are all kinds of items in the dungeons including herbs which can be eaten or thrown, magic scrolls which can be read, swords and shields that can be equipped and staffs which can be waved until their charges are depleted. Players must also keep an eye on Torneko's hunger meter and eat regularly, otherwise Torneko will go into starvation and start losing hitpoints at a great rate.<br><br>There are several ways to leave a dungeon including death, an Outside Scroll, donating to a Priest or reaching the very bottom floor. When leaving the dungeon areas, Torneko's experience points and stats are lost. To make money, he must sell items he has collected from the dungeon, but may keep a couple of his items in the Storage Room for later use. Torneko's village initially starts small, but as progress in made in the game more and more services and shops will be attracted to it. Some examples of services include a Bread Baker, a Witch, a Blacksmith, a Builder and a Meldersmith.

Description=The Worldwide Edition of Yu-Gi-Oh! is another chance to play Yu-Gi-Oh! on the Gameboy Advance.  The main point of the game is to allow you to battle others with your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck.  You choose to move to the next area or stay in your current area of the map and battle whoever is there.<br><br>When you are in the map mode, you have the option of staying where you are and battling anyone in your area who will battle, or moving to an area adjacent to your own.  To help you decide what to do, the map will show you the people in your space and the spaces around your space.  Depending on what is shown to you, you can easily tell if each person wants to talk to you or battle you.  If you have not battled a person yet, you will not be able to see who they are until you choose to battle them (except with a small number of people you already know to start the game).<br><br>Each week you can get 5 more cards through a magazine that you are given.  If you choose to, you can add these to your deck right away.  Otherwise, you can leave them in your trunk to be added later.<br><br>Each weekend, you can participate in a tournament if you're in the right location that weekend to do so.  Winning the tournaments can gain you some new cards by opening up new (locked) booster packs of cards that you can choose from when you win battles.<br><br>As you get more cards, Duelist Points, or just win many times against a single opponent, you will also open up more booster packs to choose from when winning duels.<br><br>The game also allows for dueling friends using a link cable, or even trading cards with friends.

Description=The first of many sequels to The Legend Of Zelda. Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.<br><br>Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). <br><br>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a top-down view (when traveling the land) and side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link cannot do much except for walking: in the side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, cast spells, collect items and talk to people. <br><br>When Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, or enters a location which contains enemies, he can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a shield which protects him against some of the enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his health completely by encountering a fairy in the wilderness, or by using the services of a healer in a town. <br><br>Link also has a "magic" meter. He can cast spells (as long as he learned them first) if he has some magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. They have various effects: they cure Link, allow him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars sometimes left behind by enemies. <br><br>When Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an item, or give Link some experience. When Link gains enough experience, he gains a level, which allows him to buy weapon power/maximum magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience points, or he can decide not to buy anything and stockpile his experience points for later use. <br><br>There are some items to be found that are necessary to get past certain points in the game. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.

Description=On the planet Zi, far away in the universe, there are both good and evil inhabitants. To gain control of the planet, they use mechanized robots called Zoids to battle for control of the world. During an experiment, Zoids warriors from different eras, the Chaotic Century and the New Century, collide. Players take control of Zoids warrior Zeru, who wants to restore the chaos with the help of his friends Van, Fiona and Bit Cloud. There are different types of Zoids to choose from, and each one of them can be upgraded and customized.<br><br>Zeru is given a simple robot and has to participate in tournaments to earn money and collect new ones. He gets to meet Juno who gets kidnapped and a man called Dr. T tells him about the fusion that brought past, present and future together. By fighting in turn-based battles (with up to six-to-six match-ups), the player collects crystals left behind by defeated Zoids that can be turned into new ones by visiting the lab in one of the many towns. There, the robots can be upgraded too in different areas, with defensive and offensive elements, for both long-ranged and melee combat. Prior to each match players define the deck command. This affects the entire team, influencing the cash, salvaged parts or offering the possibilities to fuse all Zoids into a large creature. Each turn offers the player to attack, wait (and regenerate) or use an item. Some Zoids are accompanied by organoids, robot friends, that can fuse into the main Zoid for enhanced abilities.<br><br>The main story mode takes place in 40 villages with 151 base Zoids to collect. There is also a challenge mode with consecutive, increasingly difficult battles, and multiplayer through the link cable. Except for fighting, this mode can also be used to trade Zoids and parts.

You take control of a young man who, after a series of events, finds himself in possession of a new type of L.E.V. (a giant combat robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces with the Anti-Terrestrial League.<br><br>Gameplay alternates between Story sequences and tactical turn-based combat in which you control a number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, durability, movement range and armament. Unlike close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. (interactive action system) comes into play. When attacking, you have a limited amount of time to move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an enemy, you must try to keep your own target icon away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on and off in the options menu.<br><br>At the end of each chapter, you can upgrade your L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can sometimes be found during missions. In the "balance" sub-screen, you can determine whether an L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, evasion or minimizing damage.

Description=Arthur and the Invisibles is an officially licensed game for the French film of the same name (Arthur et les Minimoys in French). Players assume the role of 10 year old Arthur. His grandmother is about to lose her house and Arthur wants to stop this. Instead of the conventional channels Arthur travels to the land of the Minimoys; minuscule creatures just a tenth of an inch tall. Here he searches for his grandfather's treasure together with princess Selenia. This treasure should save the house. But to find it they'll have to travel to the forbidden city ruled by the evil M. the Malicious.<br><br>The Minimoy world consists of the house and its garden, but in an up-scaled size, since the characters are very small. Unlike the PC and console version, which is in 3D, the Game Boy Advance version uses a sidescrolling perspective. The player gets to play as both Arthur, Selenia and her little brother Betamesh. Each character has its own abilities. Arthur is more acrobatic, Selenia has a knife with which she can cut through foliage and Betamesh is smaller and can use this advantage to creep through smaller areas. The story in the game closely follows the script of the film.

Description=Astro Boy: Omega Factor is a side-scrolling action game based off a 2003 remake of Osamu Tezuka's classic Astro Boy anime and manga series from the 1960s. You play as the young, boylike robot Astro Boy, a true mechanical pacifist who's biggest dream is that one day humans and robots can coexist in peace. Armed with a strong punch, rocket powered feet and the ability to shoot laserbeams from your fingers, arms and behind, you set off on a quest against all sorts of evildoers from the Astro Boy series.<br><br>The game has two distinctive types of levels: the more prevalent beat-em-up levels and the shooter-esque levels. During the beat-em-up levels you can walk around freely and your flying ability is limited to short bursts. The shooter levels differ from each other: sometimes you can float around the screen and shoot in both directions, other times you are flying in a set direction in a more on-the-rails fashion.<br><br>The Omega Factor mentioned in the title is actually a simple upgrading system for your weapons. Every time Astro meets someone new (be they good or bad) he or she will be added to the Omega factor screen and Astro can upgrade one of his six weapons or abilities.

Description=The CIMA aliens feed on humankind hopes and dreams. They build elaborate mazes and trap people inside them as a way of producing their food. A force called "Gate Guardians" was created to protect the population from this menace. Three Guardians were on a train delivering settlers to a distant station, when suddenly a portal for another dimension appeared and transported everyone to a strange moon-like place. The Guardians must find the way home and bring back safely every passenger.<br><br>CIMA: The Enemy is a RPG with strategic elements. Although labeled a RPG, the game doesn't have the usual trappings of the genre: there is no levelling up, nor any form of currency or shops to buy equipment. Instead, the game is focused on the management of a huge party of characters (16 by the end of the game). The main objective is to guide these civilians on mazes, using their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Each character has a special trait that can be used to the player's advantage (a medic that concots health potions, a blacksmith that upgrades armor and weapons, etc).<br><br>Pressing the R button brings up a cross with the party portraits at each point and a multicolor cross on the middle. The characters can be individually guided by selecting their portraits or moved in groups by selecting the multicolor cross. Three way-points can be set for easier manouvering (almost a necessity, the characters have a tendency to get stuck on corners and walls). The groups to be moved can be selected by hitting the L button (a cross with numbered tents at each point appears).<br><br>One crucial gameplay aspect is the amount of trust the party members have on their Guardians. Each character has a gauge that shows the amount of trust they have. This number increases and decreases according to actions within the game. If a character is hurt his/her trust decreases, and a red heart with an arrow pointing downwards appears over his/her head. Likewise, if a character sees a guardian slaying a monster the opposite effect happens, and a green heart with an upwards arrow appears over his/her head. Trust is important because the characters only cooperate with the Guardians when they have the right amount of it.<br><br>Using the START button brings up a cross with the following functions:<br><br>? The south point has a wrench icon. It accesses the game options menu that can save the game (at any time), quit it or change the text speed.<br><br>? The north point has a face with a speech ballon icon. It is the dialogue screen, where the characters speak about the situation and how they are feeling.<br><br>? The middle of the cross has a sword and a potion icon. It is the inventory screen, where potions and other items can be equipped on a cross. The main character's inventory cross can be accessed in-game by pressing the A button. The other characters use items automatically when needed (they don't equip them automatically, though).<br><br>? The east point has a stylized file of people icon. This is the group screen, where characters can be organized in groups for easier management and manouvering.<br><br>? The west point has a stylized body and heart icon. It is the statistics screen, where the player can check what weapons, stats and armor each character has.<br><br>The top-left of the main game screen shows the health points bar of the main character. Below that occasionally is shown a health bar of any near party member being attacked.

Description=Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.<br><br>Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

Description=In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.<br><br>The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.<br><br>The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. <br><br>Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. <br><br>There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. <br><br>To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. <br><br>If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. <br><br>The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.

Description=The first of many sequels to The Legend Of Zelda. Link has just turned 16, and discovers a strange birthmark on his hand. With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.<br><br>Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). <br><br>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a top-down view (when traveling the land) and side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link cannot do much except for walking: in the side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, cast spells, collect items and talk to people. <br><br>When Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, or enters a location which contains enemies, he can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a shield which protects him against some of the enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his health completely by encountering a fairy in the wilderness, or by using the services of a healer in a town. <br><br>Link also has a "magic" meter. He can cast spells (as long as he learned them first) if he has some magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. They have various effects: they cure Link, allow him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars sometimes left behind by enemies. <br><br>When Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an item, or give Link some experience. When Link gains enough experience, he gains a level, which allows him to buy weapon power/maximum magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience points, or he can decide not to buy anything and stockpile his experience points for later use. <br><br>There are some items to be found that are necessary to get past certain points in the game. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.

Donald, however, gets a barrel and a hammer because his butt's too big for the armor. Both costumes has its pros and cons - for example, Donald's weapon can only be aimed forward while Mickey's can be aimed up/down/forward.  But, in water Mickey's armor will drag him down and sink while Donald's can float.  If playing with two players, these attributes can be used together so, for example, Mickey can take a ride on Donald's back across the water. <br><br>In each stage, there are various hidden doors which will give you access to Bonus Games, shops and areas with coins and treasures. In a Bonus Game,  you will pick one of our three cards and unless you get the card with King Pete's picture, you will receive some sort of prize.

Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.<br><br>Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.<br><br>The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.

Description=Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China,  it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.<br><br>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.

Taking the wind into account, players can choose from different clubs, determine the direction and finally the strength of the shot based on a moving bar requiring the player's timing for accuracy.

The main buttons are used for basic attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button triggers special abilities known as "incredi-moves". Each member has a different special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. Using these depletes an additional meter on the screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies.<br><br>Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can also collect band-aid to restore your health, extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences (playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D visuals from the film. After completing a level, you receive a password to continue the next time.

The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. Incredible but the other members of the family, along with Frozone, are playable in the later levels. The main buttons are used for basic attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button triggers special abilities known as "incredi-moves". Each member has a different special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. Using these depletes an additional meter on the screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies.<br><br>Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can also collect band-aid to restore your health, extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences (playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D visuals from the film. After completing a level, you receive a password to continue the next time.

Description=Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in Asia, in the near future. This is the story about the GG's, one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG's, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists. But there is light in the darkness: the underground DJ, "Professor K," and his Jet Set Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will have something much darker than the police to worry about.<br><br>As one of the GG's, you skate through a variety of different levels, from busy streets to run-down rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be unlocked by finding "Graffiti Souls" in levels, by designing new graffiti yourself, or by going online and downloading any images you find while browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs "Poison Jam" and the "Noise Tanks", the evil mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing traditional platform elements with skating similar to that of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. Players are scored on their performance in a level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the game progresses challenge maps open that test the player's ability to do larger tags, more tricks, or race against an opponent.<br><br>The American and European release contained two new levels based on New York. The story and order that you meet characters was modified to include these two levels. Both releases also have different unique soundtracks for these levels.

Description=Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule.  When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link...<br><br>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action adventure game (similar to the original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance.  Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule.  Unlike turn-based RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by pressing a button, or can spin the sword around you for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged.<br><br>Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon's particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link's latest new ability.  The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level's particular item.<br><br>Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four 'pieces of heart'; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game.  Some of Link's items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots.  After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make your way past previously impassable obstacles.<br><br>The Game Boy Advance version of the game also includes a special extra dungeon.  In addition to this, there is the first multiplayer Zelda game ever: Four Swords.  In this game puzzles are based around co-operation with other players - for example, picking up an enemy and throwing it at another player which allows its weak point to be hit, or a boss which only shows the weak point you can hit on an opponent's screen.  However, the game also contains an element of competitiveness - whoever gains the most rupees at the end of the level wins a bonus medal.  Collect enough of these and you can unlock a special quest in A Link to the Past.

Rather, the board is divided into three "flanks," and your hero in each flank generates the command points you use to move units in that flank. Thus, good leaders like Aragorn may have a lot of command points to give his flank (3-4 is typical), while Gimli may have less, but be a better warrior to make up for it.<br><br>After a battle, you can upgrade your heroes with equipment and special skills, and move onward to conquer the next area of Middle-earth.

Description=The events of this game take place twenty-five years before those depicted in  Fortress of Doom. You control a young man named Eldin. His father was a great treasure hunter who once ventured into ancient ruins and never came back. Eldin became a hunter himself, and is looking for an adventure together with his friends Torma and Rami. Before soon the youngsters come into conflict with the evil kingdom of Gratze, and realize they have to do anything to stop their plans of resurrecting an ancient beast. <br><br>This is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from top-down perspective. Enemy encounters are not random, and the enemies are visible on screen. You can gain advantage in battles if you initiate combat by approaching the enemy. The characters can master a variety of "jobs", learning abilities and switching classes, or combining them the way the player likes. You can also use special items in battle to capture monsters and to make them fight on you side. You can also upgrade those monsters and even merge with them to become more powerful.

But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of "Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.

Description=Naruto: Ninja Council is another game that was taken from a famous Japanese anime series and is also the first installment of the Ninja Council series. <br><br>It's a side scrolling, action oriented game with two modes to choose - Story mode and Free mode - and two playable characters. The story of Ninja Council starts from the survival exam and ends with Orochimarus attack at the Hidden Konoha Village. Apart from that there are no actual events between that - that take place on the anime although there are fights with certain characters that do like the fight with Haku and Orochimaru.<br><br>The characters that are available are Naruto and Sasuke. When you start a new game at the beginning of each stage Kakashi sensei appears to give you hints about the controls and other useful staff like a boss weak point or attack patterns. There are also hidden characters you can find who can restore your health when you run out of life. Stages have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete. At the end of each stage there is a boss fight and the timer resets at 5 minutes in which you have to win the battle in order to advance the game and be able to save your progress.<br><br>The two available characters - Naruto and Sasuke - can both use the same combo hits and weapons that can be picked up in each stage like shuriken and kunai. Every second stage the player will also find scrolls that contain elemental power ups like the Lightning Style Scroll that can be used either for attacking opponents or for progressing in the game. Apart from that each one has a set of three unique special attacks that can be used but only if you have sufficient amount of chakra.

Description=This is the second Naruto title for the Ninja Council series and follows the adventures of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura as they try to pass the Chunin Exam in a total of seven stages.<br><br>Unlike the first title you can now control three characters by changing them anytime you want inside the game. Each one has unique sequences of punches and kicks and can use 3 special techniques with varying results from one character to another. The shuriken, kunai and fuma from the first game are still here although this time one hit is enough to dispatch an enemy. Along the stages you can also find summoning scrolls and use them in fights to call Kakashi, Choji and others to attack the enemies. Another addition to the gameplay is the Teleport move which as the name implies allows you to teleport near or behind an enemy to attack him or simply dodge his attacks. At parts of each stage you may be given certain objectives such as to defeat all the enemies or finish the stage within a time limit and parameters like the use of only one character. At the end of each stage you get a grade depending on how many enemies you killed, how fast you finished the stage, how many characters you are left and how many leaves you have collected. At the end of the game these grades will be accumulated to decide your final rank.<br><br>The game also features two additional modes  the Co-op Mode and the Vs. Mode but you need the link cable for that.

Description=Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks have been added.<br><br>This is a puzzle game in which the player must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white). To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select the blocks in one line. In most puzzles, you can use the border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the Advance version are: Hurdle Tiles, which you cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but are removed so that the tiles above them fall down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily Polarium) ranging from very easy to quite challenging.<br><br>The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in a line results in a 30 seconds penalty. <br><br>It is possible to create your own puzzles and share them with friends. Puzzles created in the Nintendo DS version of the game are compatible with the GBA version.

While in orbit around the planet, she is attacked and quickly infected with the Scurge herself.  Jenosa has no alternative but to land onto Inos, to investigate the Scurge and find a cure.<br><br>Scurge: Hive is an action game with some similarities in storyline to Nintendo's Metroid series.  However, the game itself is significantly different from Metroid. As Jenosa, players must blast their way through Planet Inos while trying to constantly contain their own infection.  While progressing through the game, Jenosa's 'infection meter' slowly increases (faster if she is standing on red patches of Scurge) - the meter can only be reduced back to 1% by using a Decontamination Platform, which also acts as a save point.  Failing to temporarily cure Jenosa of the Scurge results in rapid depletion of life as the virus takes over, so players must complete mission objectives quickly!<br><br>Jenosa can earn experience as she blasts infected life forms; this experience will upgrade her firepower and health.  Better weaponry can be found, as well as gadgets which help Jenosa access new areas.  Some weapons are twice as effective on particular opponents; inversely, they are ineffective against other enemy types.  It's up to you to figure out the best weapon for the right situation.

You can take up to twelve different members of your Shining Force into battle. There are many different classes ranging from fighters and magicians to healers, knights, monks, ninjas and many more. In-between battles you can explore various towns to buy new weapons and items or chat with the townsfolk. There are also a number of secret characters and items to be discovered.<br><br>Shining Force's gameplay has also seen some changes. The interface has been slightly simplified and you can now organize your units before battles. During battles, it is now possible to view upcoming turns, which makes it much easier to plan your next steps. To make the battles more interesting, even for fans of the original, you receive certain bonuses (usually money or a weapon) for completing battles in a set number of turns. Finally, a card-collecting side-quest has been added. Cards can have various effects in battle and one character is able to transform into the cards that you have found.

You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.

The last free nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring the Motorhead Empire down using its newly developed weapon, the lightning bomb.<br><br>Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling shooter. At the beginning of every level, the player gets to choose between a striker plane and a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore sustain more damage. Both ships use the same standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or backwards, as well as bombs that are released automatically while firing. Also available is a limited number of lightning bombs that damage or destroy all enemies on screen. <br><br>Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience points.<br><br>Options are small "drones" that fly alongside the player's ship and mimic its behaviour.<br><br>Experience points can be collected to level up the ships' weapons (up to level 20) and thereby increase their fire power.

It is your job to protect the seal trapping Goura, a stray summon creature who is too powerful for anyone to control.  Similar to Summon Night: Swordcraft Story, your father died 3 years ago.  He died trying to trap Goura after a summoner tried to free Goura and take control of him.  Now it is your job to protect that seal, while you are working at becoming a Craftknight.<br><br>A Craftknight is a person who creates weapons and uses them, similar to an armorer.  However, these weapons are made with the combined power of your hammer and your Guardian Beast.  You will have the ability to choose between 4 Guardian Beasts shortly after starting the game.  Each one has different abilities and will have different conversations throughout the game.  Unlike in the previous game, you do not learn techniques for making weapons, but instead you use shapestones to create a weapon type.  There are 6 weapon types that can be made and you will need at least a basic weapon from each type in order to reach all areas of the game.  The actual weapon you create will be determined by the material you use to create it.  If you make it with Iron Ore, it will be one kind of weapon, while if you make it with Aqua Ore, it will be another kind of weapon.  Later, you will have the ability to upgrade the weapons up to three times each.<br><br>Battles are the same as in the previous game. You fight in a side scrolling area with up to 4 enemies.  You can use your weapon to attack, or use your Guardian Beast's magic to attack, heal or protect you, or enchant your weapon in some way.  Some weapons will also have special attacks that can do even more damage.  In this game, you'll have battles above and below ground, rather than just in the dungeon and arena.  You also have the ability to Mono Shift, where you will change into a more powerful being.  You can only do this once before recharging the item that allows you to Mono Shift.

The game includes 32 national teams (some with their real stars) plus 6 all star teams to be unlocked in 3 game modes (Exhibition, Pro Beach Soccer Tour and Tournament)  played in Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro, Marseille or Venice Beach.<br><br>Gameplay is classic arcade, with one button to pass, another to juggle the ball and another to shoot. One of the key aspects is the "State of Grace"; by making fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the ball back and forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it's full, all team attributes are maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly run with the ball.

But what happens instead is that hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, with no buttons and an addictive tilt control!  Wario's gonna be even richer than ever before when he sells this!<br><br>WarioWare Twisted! is the sequel to the sleeper hit WarioWare Inc.: Mega: Microgame$!.  It includes a built-in rumble pack and gyro sensor which the games have been designed around.  Over two hundred five second games are hurled at the player as they make their way through the stage, trying to figure out what to do with a short description like "Play!", "Avoid!" or "Digest!".  Each stage has a random game thrown at you, with a short time to complete it.  Fail it, and you lose one of your four lives.  Lose all four and it's game over.  Pass enough games, and you'll get told "FASTER!" and the games start coming at you at a quicker speed.  Finally, you'll encounter a Boss Stage, which has no time limit and is tougher to beat.<br><br>Each character's stage is based around a different 'theme'.  Mona's games require you to make only a small spin to pass them, Jimmy T.'s games need a consistent rhythm to play, Kat and Ana's games simply need the use of the A Button, Dr. Crygor's games involve changing gravity itself, while the Nintendo nerd pair 9-Volt and 18-Volt have a set of Nintendo games which use all of the different styles of play from the other game sets.<br><br>Twisted! also has a huge amount of novelty unlockables to collect.  Once you've played through Story Mode, you can replay the games again for a higher score and bonus toys.  Whenever you beat a Boss Game after completing Story Mode once, you'll be prompted to spin to get a bonus prize.  This prize could be as simple as a light wand that you shake to see a picture, or a small arcade-style game involving sewing or rolling a cat around the floor while shooting bugs.

Unlike close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. (interactive action system) comes into play. When attacking, you have a limited amount of time to move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an enemy, you must try to keep your own target icon away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on and off in the options menu.<br><br>At the end of each chapter, you can upgrade your L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can sometimes be found during missions.
