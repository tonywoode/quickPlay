Description=The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.<br><br>The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.

Their goal is to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.<br><br>This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the "Instant Fun" option. They vary from a "Memory" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as "Throw a Roman Mini Game".<br><br>Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).

Description=Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.<br><br>Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.

Select which animal you'd like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal's head or back or scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking, rolling over, purring, or barking.<br> <br>There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and if you do well enough, you'll see the animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic and spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players' mouse mastery and hand-eye coordination.

Description=Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).<br><br>At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.<br><br>Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

Each character takes a different route towards the bad guy and as a result the stages scroll differently for each character. You can collect upgraded items and weapons but there's no character upgrading besides that. The game also features mid-level bonus rounds featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in several arcade mini-games as traditional for the series.

Description=Another RPG title for the Ganbare Goemon series. Once again you take control of the wily adventurer Goemon and his buddies as they travel through feudal Japan fighting evil in its wackiest incarnations. This time around an evil warlord seems to have taken control of Edo castle and used the place to flood all of Japan with strange demons. <br><br>The gameplay is similar to the other RPGs in the series, in which you control your party from an overhead map and explore each area getting quests and items in order to advance the main plot. While you control a party, combat is strictly one-on-one, as the game attempts to join the Pokémon craze with "dueling" combat between individual monsters. Additionally, you can capture and train the monsters you defeat, and even upgrade them or merge them with other creatures to obtain additional powers. The game can also connect with the similarly-themed Mononoke Sugoroku for the N64, in order to transfer and exchange monsters between both titles.

Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.<br><br>The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the <br>big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.<br><br>Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.<br><br>The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.

Description=Hanasaka Tenshi Tentenkun no Beat Breaker is a hybrid of the game Simon and a match-3 puzzle game.  Four buttons are required to play - left and right on the Control Pad, and the A and B buttons.  The game screen is split in half.  The top half contains eight columns, followed by a striped line, and then an empty white area.  To the left of the game screen is the time bar.  As you complete rounds, the bar increases.  When the bar reaches the top of the clock, the level is complete.  If your white area fills up beyond the striped lines, the game is over.<br><br>Each round has eight notes played in a specific rhythm.  After they are played, they play again, and this time, after each note is played, circles fall down the columns.  Your goal is to press a button when the circles hit the striped line, which turns them into colored circles with either arrows, A or B on them.  These then land in the bin.  If you miss hitting a note, the circles turn into black angry face circles, which are more difficult to clear.  Perform enough beats correctly and happy face circles will appear - these act as wildcards.<br><br>When three or more colored circles line up horizontally, they clear from the screen and points are scored.  While you could complete levels by simply pressing the same button in time over and over, the other buttons can be used to set up combos, allowing for bigger points.  In addition, if you press a note incorrectly, sometimes a different button symbol will fall instead, which you must then strategically try to clear.

Description=As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of the son of a brilliant scientist who has discovered a means to travel through time. Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian's first mission is to use his father's discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner.<br><br>You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.

Description=The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics.<br><br>To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which increases defense, for example).<br><br>Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.<br><br>Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.

Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.<br><br>Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)<br><br>In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.

As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.<br><br>Color Collison. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time.<br>The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.<br><br>Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.

Description=Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. <br><br>Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.<br><br>In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. <br><br>During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.<br><br>By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.

Description=The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards: Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies.<br><br>This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.

To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system: Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only takes away a part of a heart.

Description=This is a Japan only release, not to be confused with the USA release Bomberman GB, which is a different game.<br><br>In the one player game, you are placed in an arena with a dark Bomberman for a best-two-out-of-three round. You must, using your bombs, blow him up without getting blown up yourself. After you beat him, the process repeats with two Bombermen then three Bombermen.<br><br>After you beat the three Bombermen in two out of three rounds, you must beat a boss character to move on. When playing the rounds, you can find power-ups to increase the blast size, allow more than one bomb on the screen and, temporarily, make you invincible. When you beat the bosses, you gain things like the ability to kick a bomb away, run faster, ram enemies, etc.<br><br>In a multi-player game, two to four players do their best to blow each other up. Multi-player is done with the Super Game Boy on a SNES. More than two players is only possible with a multitap.<br><br>This game was released in the U.S. as Wario Blast, with some changes. The animated opening was removed and, of course, Wario was added.

The new levels are the major difference between Boxxle 2 and its predecessor as there are no graphical changes to speak of. To solve all these levels, you'll once again have to push crates onto certain spots, which is made difficult by the fact that you can only push but not pull them so that it can easily happen that you push a crate into a dead end or block your own way.

Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the "Daytime" and the "Nighttime". These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.

Description=Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

New to Duck Tales 2 is the ability to push and pull certain objects with the cane after hitting them.<br><br>Familiar faces such as Huey, Dewey and Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, and Launchpad McQuack all turn up to lend a hand.  Scrooge will even bump into the crazy inventor, Gyro Gearloose, who will improve Scrooge's cane so that he can access even more secret areas.

Description=You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.<br><br>Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:<br><br>1. Shooting them with his gun.<br>2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.<br>3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.<br>4. Crushing them with an elevator.<br><br>Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.<br><br>While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. <br><br>Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.<br><br>Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.<br><br>If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.

Description=This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.

Battling is not actually performed by the player, instead it is all automatic.  If you bump into an enemy, you will see a dust cloud appear, and the pair will scuffle, with each character's health draining.  Whoever loses all their health first loses the battle.  Sablé can increase his battle advantage by collecting heart containers (to increase his life bar), and power ups that increase statistics like power and defense.<br><br>Another feature of Kaeru No Tame Ni Kane Wa Naru is Sablé's ability to transform into a frog at certain points in the game.  This allows him to access areas that he previously could not.

Description=In the distant future, a monopolistic and technological corporation called Ultratech organizes a fighting tournament known as "Killer Instinct". Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  <br><br>Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game published by Nintendo (and distributed in the arcades by Midway).  Killer Instinct (or "KI" among its fanbase) is a 2D fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from 10 characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder.  <br><br>Killer Instinct is known for its heavy combo based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land an insane number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the "Ultra Combo".  The gameplay is also known for its use of combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.

Description=This cartridge contains the entire King James Version Bible, complete with simple or complex word search option, as well as two word games.<br><br>The first of the word games is Bible Word Match, sort of a Bible-word-themed version of the Milton Bradley board game Memory. Words are randomly selected from the Bible and hidden in pairs on the screen. Move the flashing box to a hidden word and press A. The word will be revealed. Now move to another hidden word and press A. If the two words match, you gain ten points and the words will disappear from the screen. If they do not match, you lose five points and the words will be covered again. After three correct matches in a row, a cherry will appear. Capture it to get a thirty point bonus. After five correct matches in a row, a Boom will appear. Capture it to reveal all words briefly.<br><br>The other word game is Bible Shepherd, a Bible-themed version of Hangman. You have three sheep in a pen, the alphabet to select from and a word who's letters are hidden, showing only blank spaces. Move your cursor to a letter and press A. If the letter is not in the word, the sheep will stop moving. Select an incorrect letter again and one of the sheep will jump out of the pen. If you select a correct letter, its location(s) will be revealed in the word and, if you have sheep outside the pen, one will jump back in. You get one hundred points for each correct guessed word plus ten points for any sheep in the pen when the word is guessed correctly. If all three sheep jump from the pen before you can reveal the word, you lose.

Description=Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game.  There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:<br><br>Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more stars you clear, the higher the score.<br><br>Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.<br><br>Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. <br><br>Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.<br><br>The game also features a clever 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further!

The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.<br><br>While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit.

The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. <br><br>The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.<br><br>Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. <br><br>Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.<br><br>Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.<br><br>Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. <br><br>Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.<br><br>The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

Description=Lunar Lander is a space exploration game based around three separate stages:<br><br>Lift-off: Fly your space shuttle into outer space by following the guidance arrows displayed on the screen. If you don't centre the shuttle according to the signs, your progress is slowed down and you will run out of fuel before leaving Earth's gravitation. You must also keep an eye on your compressor, since it must be constantly at a high level for the rockets to boost sufficiently. Feeding the compressor too much will deplete your fuel, though, so everything must be balanced for the lift-off to be successful.<br><br>Landing: This stage is very similar to the old Lunar Lander type of game that was popular in the early eighties. From a map of the moon, you select one of eight landing sites. On the landing screen, you must carefully guide your lander through the cave-like craters to the landing pads. Different landing pads are worth different amounts of points, according to level of difficulty. Preserving your lander's fuel will also give bonus points. Unlike most typical Lander games, your craft has no rockets for going left or right – instead you must rotate your lander and ignite the single landing rocket in order to adjust your angle. There are also meteorites to watch out for.<br><br>Exploration: Once you have landed, an astronaut steps out on the surface, armed with a metal detector. Your task here is to find five different kinds of metal ore and bring them to the lander before you run out of air or time. The metal detector beeps with different frequencies according to your vicinity to a piece of metal. If there is a constant beep, you drill for the metal. If you drill elsewhere, you may find flowers that replenish your air supply. To complicate things, the moon surface is filled with robots that try to hunt you down. Contact with a robot wears down your air supply. <br><br>After you have landed and explored all eight areas, your mission is completed and you proceed to the next one, which is more of the same.

Description=If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.<br><br>These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.<br><br>Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.<br><br>The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

On a grid, you click in a cell and hope that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, you can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, you progress to the next minefield.<br><br>Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes you to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.<br><br>A second mode is a mission mode, where you are presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on.

Description=Nail'N Scale is a mixture of Jump'n Run and puzzle game. The player character can jump and throw nails at his enemies. Apart from killing enemies, nails can also serve as platform when they are thrown into blocks. Some blocks can be destroyed when you throw a nail into them and jump on the nail, whereas other blocks cannot even be penetrated by the nails. As the game progresses, levels get more and more complicated and new types of nails,such as explosive nails that remove particularly resilient blocks, become available.

You control a succession of the USA's elite fighters with the aim of destroying missiles held by terrorists. You must work your way through levels and find the exit to get to the next level. At the beginning and end of each level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to progress the story of the game.<br><br>You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins.<br><br>The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no ladders ladders or ropes and you don't have to place bombs. This is possibly due to technical or game pack memory limitations of the Game Boy.

Description=This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.<br><br>Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.<br><br>The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:<br><br>1. &quot;Hot Spots&quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.<br><br>Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &quot;on-fire,&quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.<br><br>&quot;Juice Mode&quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.<br><br>&quot;Tournament Mode&quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.

Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.<br><br>Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.<br><br>Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. <br><br>Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.<br><br>The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.<br><br>Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.

As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.<br><br>Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.<br><br>The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.<br><br>All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

Description=Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. <br><br>Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. <br><br>You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.

The puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time.<br><br>Picross 2 has two modes of play: the first, Mario's Picross, has you solving Picross puzzles with Mario.  In this mode, the timer ticks down from 30 minutes, and you must solve the puzzle before the timer reaches zero.  If you chip away an incorrect square, you are penalized time (first two minutes, then four, then eight).<br><br>After solving a certain amount of puzzles in Mario's Picross mode, you can play Wario's Picross.  In this mode, the timer starts from zero and counts upwards.  You are not penalized time for any mistakes, however, this means that you do not know which squares are correct and which ones are incorrect until the puzzle is complete.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Description=Pokémon Yellow, along with Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Red forms the first generation of Pokémon games.  You control a number of fictional animals known as Pokémon and must travel the land using your current Pokémon to defeat and capture more.  <br><br>There are 151 Pokémon that fall into various types such as fire, water and grass that have a complicated rock-paper-scissors relationship.  You come across a series of town, each of which contains a gym where you must do battle with other Pokémon trainers.  Each gym specializes in a different type of Pokémon.  After beating each gym, you are given a new ability that lets you travel to new areas.<br><br>The object of the game is to defeat all eight gym leaders, or ultimately, to catch all the varieties of Pokémon.  Some of them are not actually catchable in Yellow, so you must use the Game Boy link function to trade with friends using Red and Blue to complete your collection.<br><br>Pokémon Yellow differs from the other first-generation games because it is based on the Pokémon animé series.  The main character looks like Ash and he starts the game with Pikachu, rather than choosing a Pokémon as in all other games in the series.  Character graphics throughout the game are based on designs from the series and it includes Jesse, James and their Meowth, which the other games do not.

Description=In this vaguely Tetris-like game, players score points by eliminating "star blocks."  A star block is a colored rectangle with a star on one end of it, and blocks are eliminated when the stars of two like-colored blocks touch each other.  While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen.  The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks.

Description=The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.<br><br>There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)<br><br>The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.

Description=In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban.<br><br>Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional – or even four-dimensional – thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared.<br><br>A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.

Description=Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.<br><br>By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.<br><br>Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

Description=When Sonia Snake is kidnapped by the Nasty Nibbler, only two snakes can save her!  It's up to Attila and Genghis to eat their way through sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps and open the exits by standing on the scales to open the exit door.<br><br>Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game Snake, Rattle 'n Roll.  However, instead of an isometric playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer.  Players can play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels.  The goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments.  When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level.<br><br>Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it.  To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit.  You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.

Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.<br><br>Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.

Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.<br><br>On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.<br><br>Finally, the game has two puzzle modes.

Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.<br><br>The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.

Description=Quasimodo straps on his trusty hump one last time to rescue his paramour, the perpetually-imperiled Esmeralda, this time captured by a new villain, the horrible Halfenpounder.  You must run, jump, and eat fruit (can malnutrition cause a hunched back?  Can nutrition reverse it?) through a varied series of platform environments, jumping over (and atop) rolling logs that will briefly daze you if you mistime your jump and spiked pits that will, well, skewer you as surely as in the original, swinging on ropes, and signaling the end of each level by ringing an enormous bell there specifically for that purpose.  Since our pal Quasi is from Paris, not Krypton, and doesn't grow large eating mushrooms, one must conclude that it is the amusing idle animations and hidden bonus stages that lend the "Super" prefix to this game.

Description=The very first installment of the Super Robot Taisen series is quite different from all of its successors; most notably, the robots are treated as sentient organisms, and all pilots are absent from the game. As the intro tells, they live on the planet of super robots, when a mysterious space creature know as Gil Gil Gan takes control of most the planet's inhabitants and launch a destructive war.<br><br>The basic interface is like every other SRT game: your robots are placed out on a map grid with different terrain types. Placing the cursor above a robot and pushing a button brings up a menu with basic choices for movement, attack, status and special options. A similar menu is displayed if you move your robot close to an enemy unit, offering options to attack, use spiritual powers or negotiate. After all robots have moved, the turn is over, and the game switches to the enemy phase.<br><br>All robots are licensed from two parties only – Sunrise and Dynamic – and when starting the game you may choose to start with the Gundam team, the Mazinger team or the Getter Robo team. One robot must be designated as the team leader, which allows you to upgrade its statistics with a number of points. If the leader robot is destroyed in battle, the game is over. Unlike later games, destroyed units are not repaired after a scenario is cleared, but may show up as an enemy unit later on. This puts a lot more emphasis on the negotiation command than later games, since a lot more enemy units may in fact turn out to be friends. Few of them will listen unless you have first brought down their HP to a minimal amount, though.<br><br>Apart from HP, each unit has XP. Experience is gained for each enemy unit that is destroyed, and a level up adds to all aspects of your robot; speed, force, armor, HP and SP. SP, or spiritual power, is like MP in conventional RPGs, allowing a unit-specific set of ”spiritual commands” to be executed. These usually change game variables, such as force of attack, speed of dodging or health. Health is otherwise regenerated by putting a unit in one of the bases spread out on each map. When first entering a base, you gain a power-up item. These are fitted to your robots between scenarios and include new weapons and shields.<br><br>Each battle is displayed as a small animation, but it is all very primitive compared to later games in the series, even on the Game Boy, with little movement apart from the bullets and lasers. Preceding each battle you have initiated yourself, you may choose your weapon. Weapons may be hand-to-hand or ranged. Ranged weapons are advantageous since your opponent may not fire back – this is true even of enemy units which possess ranged weapons of their own. All weapons have also properties for their accuracy and power, which are altered according to the terrain and whether enemies are at sea, on the ground or airborne.

The player takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon awakens.<br><br>The main difference between The Sword of Hope II and its predecessor<br> is the fact that you have control over a party of up to three characters rather than controlling only prince Theo.

Also, they are teenage turtles, which means they all talk like surfers and like to eat pizza.  An equally mutated, but apparently much older, rat named Splinter acts as the turtle's guardian.  He trains the turtles to be ninjas, and to fight crime.  He also gives the turtle's their names: Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo.<br><br>In the game, the Turtles' TV reporter friend, April, is kidnapped by the evil samurai, Shredder.

Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.

Description=This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, and was included with the Game Boy upon its release in several territories. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.<br><br>The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES version of the game, featuring the same "Type A" endless and "Type B" set-clear modes. The game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing lines in this mode will cause the other player's stack to rise, with the goal being to make the other player lose.

Description=Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way. Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.

Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.<br><br>Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi's Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally.

The young Shabubu's trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as well as to kick enemies, Yacopu's primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other platformers, many of the enemies don't harm you on contact and push your character around instead. However, certain foes might attack you after you damaged them, while others do so from the beginning.<br><br>At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to reach places he wouldn't otherwise be able to, while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come across power-ups that temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds, bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the mountain, settings in the game include a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In each stages, you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, you will encounter the one who stole the Maita Flower. The flower must be retrieved in order to save peace in Trip World.

But whereas that title was a beat-em-up, Hakaishin Garumaa instead takes place as a turn-based board game RPG. Similar in design to the later Mario Party titles, players begin by choosing one of three of the undercover cops. The player begins at the start location of the board and must use one of their "numbered value tiles". If the number chosen is above 1, the player must compete on a slot machine to try to win a value up to what was written on the tile. Following that, the player is able to move the number value, which they have won, of spaces on the board. Certain squares will activate events that include talking with characters, buying items and engaging in battle.<br><br>Battles with enemies are handled by each side choosing one of the numbered tiles they own. The party with the higher number becomes the attacker and the lower value becomes the defender. Each side then chooses another numbered tile to determine the amount of "effort" put into the attack or defense as well as a position of the body to attack/defend. With that chosen, the turn's sequence plays out, with HP lost on a successful impact. Upon defeating an opponent in battle, the player gains XP and gold.

Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.

Description=Wario, Mario's greedy rival from Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, is more determined than ever to get a castle after being booted out of Mario's.  He has heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island have a golden Statue of Princess Toadstool that's worth a king's ransom!  Wario figures that if he swipes the Princess' statue for himself, as well as all the other loot the pirates have hoarded, he'll have more than enough cash for a castle that's even bigger and better than Mario's!<br><br>Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 is different from previous games in the series in that you control the brutish and greedy Wario.  Even when small, Wario can break most bricks with a punch, and some enemies are so weak to him that they'll just be pushed aside!  Wario has a body slam attack that he can use to destroy enemies, and he can also pick them up and throw them at his foes.  If that wasn't enough, there are three different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies.  The Jet Hat allows him to fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump height and speed.  Finally, the Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of fire for a short period of time.<br><br>To suit Wario's greedy nature, the game revolves around money.  Throughout the stages, you can earn coins by grabbing them floating in the air, punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then collecting the coins they drop.  You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by finding a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it.  Once Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually needs to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to open.  Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door.  Once the door opens, you can exit and the level is complete.  Before you finish each level, you can choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount of coins you have, with a 50/50 chance.  You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you wish...so don't get too greedy!

Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).<br><br>The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.<br><br>The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode.

Description=Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. <br><br>Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. <br><br>You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.

The gameplay is best described as a mix between Boulder Dash and Soko-Ban.<br><br>The goal is to clear each screen of bad guys, in 100 increasingly difficult rounds. You can punch a bad guy by walking onto it from the left or right. You can't attack from above or below, but you can stand on top of a monster, or underneath a monster. Other elements to make the game more interesting are loose ground which you can stand on or dig through, ladders to climb and boulders you can push around.<br><br>You can choose to play each round as a boy or a girl, but this doesn't affect gameplay, only the background music. In some rounds, both the boy and the girl are present at the same time. You can then switch between them with select-button, using both of them in clever ways to solve the rounds. During the game, you can rewind to undo certain moves. You can play the rounds in any order, so you can skip to more difficult ones and solve them at a later time. There is a round editor to create your own puzzles, but these self made rounds can't be saved.

Description=Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game's hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father's brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.<br><br>Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. <br><br>You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.<br><br>The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

Description=Kirby's Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game.  There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:<br><br>Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more stars you clear, the higher the score.<br><br>Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.<br><br>Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. <br><br>Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.<br><br>The game also features a clever 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further!

If you defeat the boss on each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.

You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.<br><br>In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. <br><br>During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

The game is a platformer with action elements. Each level requires a puzzle to be solved within a time limit, giving the successful player a key to unlock the next level. Bad monsters will attack on most levels, so in addition to moving blocks to get to the key on each level, a player needs to dispatch bad monsters before being killed by them. There are good monsters to meet, several hidden bonus levels, bonus items, and treasure to be found.

This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.<br><br>When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.<br><br>In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

Description=Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.<br><br>The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.<br><br>Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.<br><br>The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.<br><br>All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.

And what better way is there to earn money than pushing  crates? And there are lots of crates to be pushed in all 120  levels of the game. The new levels are the major difference between Boxxle 2 and its predecessor as there are no graphical changes to speak of. To solve all these levels, you'll once again have to push crates onto certain spots, which is made difficult by the fact that you can only push but not pull them so that it can easily happen that you push a crate into a dead end or block your own way. A password records your progress, but there is no battery to save your self-created levels.

In this mode, he can simply run over enemies to defeat them and also break down barriers to get to new locations.

Description=Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.<br><br>Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)<br><br>In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.

Description=The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. <br><br>With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.<br><br>While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. <br><br>The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

Description=The third title of the Lufia series gives us an entirely new battle and dungeon system. All of the dungeons in this game are randomly generated, which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, it's a lot like Lufia 2 in the dungeon department. You see the monsters, they move when you move and you can stun them.<br><br>The battle system in this game is rather unique. You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The character in the front row deals the most physical damage, but also takes the most physical damage. Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in the middle row obviously takes and deals average damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, but you can only let 3 characters attack during a turn; One from each vertical row. <br><br>The 3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour; Blue, green, yellow or red, which means magic, defense, speed or power respectively. The other characters who are in the same vertical or horizontal row also receive the same amount of power from this character; This way, all characters share their power with eachother. <br><br>Other than that, the story circles around the Sinistrals returning - Again. Another thing that has returned is the Ancient Dungeon, but this time around, it has 200 floors and a very difficult and unexpected boss at the bottom...

This ticks Marvin off and he goes back to Earth again to take revenge on Daffy.<br><br>Marvin can only walk and shoot, so he has to rely much more on the other characters to help him (for example to fit through small holes or jump over pits).

According to Dr. Light's calculations, he has used the machine to travel roughly 37,426 years into the future. This can mean nothing good and so Mega Man, along with his dog Rush, sets out to find out more about Dr. Wily's plans.<br><br>Mega Man II follows the same formula as its predecessors, meaning the player has to complete a number of side-scrolling, platforming levels that are guarded by different bosses. Mega Man can only shoot left or right, but defeating a boss rewards him with a new weapon. Sometimes he will also find upgrades for Rush, which enable him to use Rush as a trampoline, a submarine or a jet.<br><br>While Mega Man II is not a conversion, the first four stages look and play very similar to some levels of Mega Man 2 for the NES. Likewise, levels five to eight resemble some levels of Mega Man 3. The bosses of the first eight stages are also old familiars from Mega Man 2 and 3.

The great wizard Colin pledged that he and his descendants would build and protect a temple around Zakdos' prison. However, as a thief enters the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set free and murders all that are left of the clan of Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon awakens.<br><br>The main difference between The Sword of Hope II and its predecessor<br> is the fact that you have control over a party of up to three characters rather than controlling only prince Theo.

Description=WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a  confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.<br><br>The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).<br><br>The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.<br><br>The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.<br><br>Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

Description=In Adventure Island II: Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island: Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero.<br><br>A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don't have to be used instantly but can be saved for later: before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.

Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. <br><br>You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. <br><br>The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.<br><br>Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.
