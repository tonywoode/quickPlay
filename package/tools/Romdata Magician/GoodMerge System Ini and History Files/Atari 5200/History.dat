Activision Decathlon, The (1984) (Activision) (c) 
1984 Activision, Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic 
games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four 
players can compete in the ten different events of 
a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or 
individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, 
long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 
110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, 
javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. 
 
The flat running events involve simple joystick 
waggling, which must be balanced with 
accurately-timed button presses to clear the 
hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a 
loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and 
throwing events, you must build momentum by 
waggling and then press the button to throw or 
jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment. 
 
For each event, points are earned based on how 
well you do (this can be based on your running 
time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, 
etc...), and the player with the most points at 
the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.

Adventure 2 Demo (2002) (Ron Lloyd) (c) May 07, 
2007 
 
This homebrew Atari 5200 cartridge is a direct, 
yet unofficial sequel to the Atari 2600 action 
role-playing classic Adventure. The player 
controls an unnamed knight on a quest to return 
the stolen chalice to the Seashore Kingdom's 
Castle. Like the original, Adventure II is played 
from top-down perspective, with player roaming the 
large game world.. The player character can carry 
one item at a time which are used to solve 
puzzles. 
While the main player graphic remains a square, 
the world of Adventure II is far larger and more 
robust than the original. The game's 32k cartridge 
features 4 distinct kingdoms, complete with unique 
inhabitants, items and secrets.

Ballblazer (1984) (Atari-Lucasfilm Games) (c) 1984 
Lucasfilm Games LLC / Atari Corporation 
 
In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in 
the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first 
time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won 
the right to compete in the final round of the 
Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's 
honor and the title Masterblazer! 
 
Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, 
where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a 
one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). 
The objective of the player to kick a floating 
ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal 
(Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human 
or computer opponent. 
 
The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose 
forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance 
of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, 
automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to 
player. When a player in possession of the 
Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push 
field and launches the ball. When the match 
starts, the player must move down field and 
attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using 
the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended 
direction. 
 
The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams 
move slightly every second and the distance 
between them will shrink. The highest scoring 
goals are goals made when Goldbeams have 
disappeared across the horizon (Over The 
Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to 
steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside 
the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game 
ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 
consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, 
over-time will apply and the first player to score 
will win the game. 
 
Scoring 
 
Close-in goals - 1 point 
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points 
OTH shots - 3 points 
Players may steal points from each other by making 
goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot 
accede more than 10 points. 
A player winning 10 consecutive points 
automatically wins the game.

Beef Drop (c) Sep 10, 2004 
 
This game is an attempt to bring a better version 
of the coin-op game BurgerTime to the Atari 8-bit 
computer and any version to the Atari 5200 and 
Atari 7800. The game play is the same as the 
coin-op game. You, the chef, must make burgers by 
walking on the parts so they drop down to plates 
below. You are pursued by Mr. Yolk (a fried egg), 
Mr. Dill (a pickle slice) and Frank (a hot dog). 
If you are cornered, you can throw pepper on the 
food to stop it for a short time. If you can catch 
them in some burger parts, you get bonus points. 
Occasionally, a bonus item, like an ice cream 
cone, will appear and you can collect it for 
points.

You have been sent into a building infested with 
robots, and must do your best to clear it out. 
Each rooms has a number of walls through the 
middle, which restrict your movement. There will 
be a number of bad guys in the room - on early 
screens they may be immobile and not shoot at you, 
but after a few levels they become capable of 
shooting in multiple directions. You can shoot at 
them in 8 directions, but can't shoot diagonally 
while moving. There are gaps at the side of each 
room, through which you exit, before or after 
clearing the room (there is a bonus for 
clearance). You get an extra life every 2000

Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is 
chasing her across the top of the screen, and you 
need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before 
time runs out, you need to construct a machine. 
The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of 
the screen, so all you need to do is locate the 
parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a 
maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it 
back and place it on the blue print. When all 
parts have been located, press the start button 
and the machine is ready to go! To make your task 
more difficult, there are several obstacles that 
get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't 
contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a 
bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs 
in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to 
time, a flower pot will fall from above and then 
hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and 
you lose a life. You also need to be careful of 
Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood 
randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also 
be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete

The object of this game is to paint all the rooms 
of a building without losing your paint brushes 
(lives) and before time runs out. You and up to 
three friends can select from any of eight player 
sprites, male or female. There are six skill 
levels with eight buildings per level. After you 
finish a building, you will be given part of a 
special message. There are six messages, one per 
skill level. 
 
You get from floor to floor by way of elevators. 
Be sure the elevator is at your floor when you 
board or you will fall down the elevator shaft. 
There are also three ladders out of the basement. 
Watch out for Flying Half-Pints. They will appear 
on one side of the building at any floor except 
the basement and will move horizontally across. 
You must jump or duck to avoid them. 
 
Starting at building number two, you must also 
avoid Dumb Buckets. These will walk around and 
ride the elevators but they always move in a set 
pattern. Starting on building three and continuing 
every other building, you have to contend with 
Brenda, the superintendent's brat. She will put 
hand prints on your freshly painted walls, which 
will cost you forty points and require repainting 
to finish that building. You can grab the candy 
cane in these buildings and give it to her. This 
will stop her for fifteen seconds so you can 
repaint. 
 
Starting with building four, you must beware of 
the Bucket Chucker. Unlike the Dumb Bucket, he 
does not follow a set pattern, he follows you. You 
cannot destroy the Bucket Chucker but there are 
two ways he can be trapped. One way is to use the 
paint mixer, a square within a square. You touch 
it to turn it on for four seconds and if the 
Bucket Chucker touches it while it is on, he will 
shake for four seconds. You can turn the paint 
mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is 
in it, unlimited times. Another way to trap the 
Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the 
Bucket Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, 
avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The 
Bucket Chucker will then be stuck in the basement 
until you lose a brush. 
 
Starting on building five, you must jump over 
steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a 
brush. In buildings six, seven and eight, your 
brush will run dry after eight, seven or six 
rooms, respectively. To refill, simply touch the 
large paint brushes in some rooms.

Castle Blast (2002) (Ronen Habot) (c) Aug 10, 2002 
 
This game is based on the fifth screen of the 
coin-op game Phoenix. 
 
The object of this game is to destroy the Castle 
on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory 
Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of 
the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, 
then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you 
can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying 
overhead. 
 
If you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next 
level, where you will need to contend with Focused 
Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. 
There will also be stars appearing in the sky, 
making it harder to target the spaceships. 
 
If you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you 
will proceed to the next level, which adds 
ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have 
Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal 
with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your 
primary goal. 
 
Your joystick moves you left or right. The lower 
button fires VTMs, the upper button fires HTMs.

Centipede (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 Atari, Inc. / 
Atari, Inc. 
 
In Centipede, the player is trapped in the 
Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to 
ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of 
which apparently are attacking in the player in 
continuous waves. 
 
The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks 
at approaching insects to score points by pressing 
the controller button. Holding down the controller 
button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If 
the player is bitten by an insect, the player will 
be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three 
starting magic wands. 
 
Insect Opponents and Mushrooms 
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before 
attacking, which may help the player identify 
which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in 
the game are as the following: 
 
1. The Centipede 
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the 
first wave, the Centipede will have a head 
attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, 
the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body 
segments, in addition to a detached head. The 
third wave will have the Centipede with an 
attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached 
heads. These body segments will transform into 
heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the 
last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached 
heads, independently attacking the player. 
Centipede heads are worth more points than body 
segments. 
 
Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top 
of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits 
any part of the Centipede, that particular body 
segment will transform into a mushroom, while the 
body segment behind it will become the new 
Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, 
it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the 
top of the screen again. 
 
The Spider 
The Spider will attempt to distract the player 
from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any 
mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more 
points if it is hit in closer distances. 
 
The Flea 
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed 
most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down 
creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. 
The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the 
first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster. 
 
The Scorpion 
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It 
moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving 
faster. While doing so, it will poison any 
mushroom it touches. 
 
Mushrooms 
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as 
obstacles or cover for the player, with added 
effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to 
complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of 
mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous 
mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default 
mushrooms in the game and are also the the result 
of the player destroying an insect or Centipede 
body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result 
of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous 
Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to 
move straight towards the player through any 
mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially 
damaged mushroom. 
 
Game Difficulty and Variations 
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, 
Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations 
are as the following: 
 
1. One Player 
Two Player Alternating 
Two players will take turns when the active player 
is bitten. 
Dual Player Competition 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same 
time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one 
player will paralyze the other player. 
Team Play 
Two players will appear on the screen at the same 
time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one 
player will not paralyze the other player. 
 
Scoring 
The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 
12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game 
will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as 
the following: 
 
Centipede Head - 100 points 
Centipede Body Segment - 10 points

that puts you in command of an attack chopper.  
Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up 
to 16 hostages per level.  Be careful, though, 
because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop 
you -- and they won't stop shooting while you are 
rescuing those hostages! 
 
Originally released for Apple II home computers, 
Choplifter was later ported to the arcades and a 
number of video game consoles.  Many imitators and 
homages would follow.

Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you 
have to use your shovel to dig your way through 
the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two 
monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will 
continually chase you around. The only weapon that 
you carry is an air pump, which you can use to 
inflate the monsters to the point where they 
explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop 
doing so, the monsters will get turned back to 
their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are 
scattered throughout the earth, and you can use 
these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not 
find you for several seconds, they will eventually 
get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk 
through the earth. They are invincible and cannot 
be killed. From time to time, vegetables will 
appear in the center, and you can get these for 
points.

The Zorban Dreadnaughts are spaceships that are 
140,000 feet long and weigh 970 megatons, making 
them the largest, most heavily armoured spaceships 
ever created. A fleet of these large battlecraft 
are now heading towards your home planet, and it 
is your job to stop them! The game is played from 
a side scrolling overhead point of view as your 
small but agile spaceship flies past the 
dreadnaughts. On each pass your spaceship makes, 
you need to try and bomb as many of the energy 
vents as possible. When all energy vents on a 
dreadnaught are destroyed, that dreadnaught will 
explode. Time is limited, though, and if you make 
too many passes to destroy the energy vents the 
dreadnaught will be within firing range of your 
home planet and will destroy it. Each of the 
dreadnaughts are heavily armed

Frogger (1983) (Parker Bros) (c) 1983 Konami

Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a 
frog across a treacherous road and river, and to 
safety at the top of the screen. Both these 
sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, 
each of which will kill the frog and cost you a 
life if contact is made. 
 
The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable 
speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are 
the snakes which hover within on later levels. 
Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles 
(which are only there for a short time) and 
alligators (but stay away form their faces), and 
then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally 
one containing a fly for extra points. Once all 
holes have been filled, you move onto the next, 
harder, level.

avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can 
ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the

the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In 
the third location you have to hop across a flock 
of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the 
screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach 
one of the homes on each of the three screens. You 
move on to the next level when a frog has safely 
reached each of the homes on all screens.

place just after midnight when there are Gremlins

You control Billy from a 3rd person point of view. 
On each level, your goal is to catch all of the 
Mogwai and return them to their cage (located in 
the upper right corner of the screen) and to 
destroy all of the Gremlins with a sword. Each 
level has a time limit - at 6:00 am when the sun 
rises. You move on to the next level by completing 
your tasks or just surviving until 6:00, although 
more points are awarded for the former. You will 
also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned 
to the cage. 
 
On many of the levels there will be various types 
of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats 
any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may 
also be  puddles of water

After clearing each planet, there is another bonus

can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action 
shooter, however instead of piloting your 
spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in

There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity 
has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to 
save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your 
way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the 
dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where 
the miners are located before you run out of 
energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has 
several useful types of equipment. A prop pack 
will allow you to hover and fly around the 
mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers 
within. Your helmet features a short range 
microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the 
bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll 
encounter in the mines. From time to time, your 
path through the mine may be blocked by stone or 
lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks 
of dynamite which can be used to destroy these 
obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, 
though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser 
beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though 
this will take longer and use up more energy. As 
the levels progress, the mine shaft will become 
longer and more maze-like, creatures will more 
frequently block the path, and lava walls and 
pools will appear which are dangerous to the 
touch.

Each level has a variety of enemies trying to

accomplished to continue on (for example, you may 
have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop 
Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory

Joust (1983-84) (Atari) (c) 1983 Williams

In Joust, players take control of a knight with a 
lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, 
for Player 2) to do battle against 
computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop 
vultures. 
 
Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the 
enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the 
vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been 
hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. 
The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before 
they hatch and release new and increasingly more 
difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy 
knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white 
knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These 
enemy knights are not the only challenge to be 
found in the game. Players must also contend with 
crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to 
pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded 
"unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl. 
 
The game was novel for its time for being one of 
the few two-player simultaneous games in the 
arcade.

Jungle Hunt (1983) (Atari) (c) 1983 Taito 
Corporation / Atari, Inc. 
 
Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure 
experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty 
once all four have been survived.  If you don't 
survive these adventures, you will not only lose 
your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who 
has been captured by cannibals! 
 
The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can 
you swing on the vines without plummeting to your 
doom?  The second part pits you against a whole 
bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  
Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  
Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, 
you face a battle against oncoming boulders of 
varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared 
all these treacherous hazards, you still must 
confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a 
wicked spear.  Can you get past him and save the 
lovely Penelope? 
 
Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife 
play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is 
always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later 
platform games.

loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone 
Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped 
in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he 
can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to 
catch up to him and send him to prison. You will 
need to use either the escalators at the end of 
each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go 
from floor to floor. The escalators may be further 
away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you 
will need to decide which route will be faster in 
getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make 
it to the top before you catch him, you will have 
to retry that level. Harry has no intention of 
letting you catch him easily, and is hurling 
everything he can find in an attempt to slow you 
down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, 
and more will all be flying past on the screen and 
will either slow you down or send you back to the 
beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, 
Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects 
will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.

Koffi - Yellow Kopter (2002) (Ron Lloyd) (c) Feb 
24, 2003 
 
Koffi is a little kopter so when the emergencies 
came, the big kopters wouldn't let him go. But now 
he has heard that Pyro the thundercloud is using 
lightning to start fires in the forest. The fire 
needs to be put out, the animals need saving. 
Koffi wasn't allowed to help the big kopters but 
he can't just ignore this until they return. 
 
You, as Koffi, must gather water from the 
raindrops or snowflakes and destroy Pyro. You 
destroy him by bumping into him but watch out for 
his lightning. After Pyro is gone, you must hover 
close to the fire then press your button to 
release water to put out. If you don't have enough 
water, grab more raindrops or snowflakes but don't 
delay or the fire will rage out of control. You 
can get bonus points by shoving the animal under 
the trees off the screen. The forest areas are 
mountain valley, coniferous forest and windy 
vines, where you have to watch that you are not 
blown into lightning. After you clear the three 
forest areas, you must face Pyro's mom, and she is 
not happy that you beat up on her son. You kill 
her the same way as her son but she throws longer 
and faster lightning and there is an angry cloud 
moving up and down and slowly towards you. Once 
she is dead, you restart mountain valley at a 
harder level.

Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a 
valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and 
retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the 
mine alive! There are several steps that need to 
be completed before you can retrieve the crown. 
First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 
1,000 points. After you have enough points, you 
need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden 
somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is 
rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which 
can be used to locate objects (such as treasure 
chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) 
Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find 
the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer 
the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the 
entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. 
Once you have the crown, you need to make it to 
the top of the mine before time runs out. To make 
this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly 
around which can steal the crown. If this happens, 
you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the 
mine is a deadly spider

Ms. Pac-Man (1982) (Atari) (c) 1983 General 
    Computer Corporation|Midway / Atari, Inc. 
 
In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular 
Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his 
girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on 
the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of 
the original game, but added new features to keep 
the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear 
four various and challenging mazes filled with 
dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while 
avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with 
their own personalities and tactics.  One touch 
from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for 
Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her 
    pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers 
    located within the maze. During this time, the 
    ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them 
    for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 
    and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power 
    only lasts for a limited amount of time, as 
    the ghost's eyes float back to their center 
    box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man 
    again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player 
will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man 
and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

other racing cars to achieve the highest score 
possible in the shortest amount of time. 
 
Before the player can enter the Grand Prix, the 
player must first qualify by competing in the 
Qualifying Lap within 73 seconds or less. If the 
player however, does not qualify in the Qualifying 
Lap, the player may continue to race until the 
Race Timer runs after 90 seconds. The player will 
score 50 point per 5 meters and additionally 50 
points for every racing car passed. When the time 
runs out - Game Over. The player will have to 
restart the Qualifying Lap. 
 
Qualifying will enable the player to start in one 
of the eight available positions. The faster the 
lap time was, the better the starting position in 
addition to bonus score points. The number one 
starting position, is the Pole Position. 
 
During the Grand Prix, the player will compete 
against the Race Timer as well as against other 
racing cars. If the player fails to beat the Race 
Timer in any lap, the player drops out of the race 
- Game Over. Completing the race by reaching 
finishing line will grant the player 200 points 
per each second left on the Race Timer, bonus 
score for distance covered, and passing bonus 
points.

Popeye (1983) (Parker Bros) (c) 1984 Nintendo Co., 
Ltd. / Parker Brothers 
 
Popeye is a conversion of the arcade 
action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to 
win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the 
screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need 
to collect them before they hit the ground. After 
you have collected the required number of items, 
you can move on to the next, more difficult level. 
There are many obstacles trying to stop you from 
completing your task, though! Brutus wanders 
around the screen and is constantly trying to 
catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you 
can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus 
will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles 
or birds are also flying around the screen and 
will cause you to lose one of your lives if you 
are hit. Each level features a different layout of 
platforms and ladders, and will have you 
collecting different items as they float towards 
the bottom of the screen!

Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade 
  game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on

  single hop will change the tile to the desired 
  color, but on later levels you may need to hop 
  on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping 
  on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert 
  are many different creatures which wander around 
  the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and 
  Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board 
  are floating discs

In this game, you guide a marker which must draw 
rectangles and other weird objects in order to 
claim your territory, and you can either draw 
these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the 
rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the 
most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it 
will be colored in to show that you have claimed 
your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you 
need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a 
series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In 
addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks 
who travel around the border, as well as any lines 
that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who 
travels along the line that you are drawing. Once 
you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to 
the next level.

worker drones. They are gathering crystals to 
build Sinistar, who wants to destroy the universe. 
As the workers will sometimes steal your mined 
crystals, feel free to blast them. Also flying 
about are warrior ships who want to blast you to 
protect the workers and Sinistar. 
 
Once Sinistar is completed, he will announce 
"Beware! I live!" and begin chasing you. 
Hopefully, you have made enough Sinibombs to 
destroy him. As he chases you, press the fire 
button to release Sinibombs to damage him. Once he 
is completely destroyed, you are off to the next, 
harder, level.

There you'll have to combat different imperial 
vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for 
an opportunity to slip through one of the random 
openings in the energy shield. After reaching the 
Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the 
point where you can hit the core. In the following 
blow up of the station you must avoid collision 
with Death Star debris. 
 
After successful destruction the game will restart 
with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster 
Death Star build up, etc). 
 
Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before

Super Breakout (1982) (Atari) (c) 1982 Atari, Inc.

Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the 
original, but with several new game variations. 
Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by 
destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. 
To do this, you need to use the paddle at the 
bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball 
within the playfield. There are four different 
game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', 
and plays the same as the original game. 
 
This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 
'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop 
towards the bottom of the screen and the ball 
moves progressively faster and faster. When 
there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at 
the top. 
 
The other two games add a second paddle. In 
'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in 
play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single 
ball in play when you start, but two additional 
balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed 
when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.

Manufacturing Co., Inc. / CBS Electronics 
 
Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a 
top-down point of view. 
 
The player controls a warrior who is trapped in a 
dungeon. The goal is to earn as many points as 
possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures 
which wander about the maze like corridors. The 
creatures wander about at various speeds, may 
shoot darts at the player, and some even have the 
ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of 
the screen the player has a radar which can be 
used to locate creatures that are invisible. 
 
When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk 
sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and 
will only be on the screen momentarily. If the 
player destroys the creature before it escapes, 
the next dungeon will become a double score 
dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as 
many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor 
himself may appear! He moves quickly and can 
teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the 
player will earn a large amount of points. 
 
The game may be played by one player or two 
players simultaneously.

Zaxxon (1984) (Sega) (c) 1984 SEGA Enterprises 
Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises, Inc. 
 
The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in 
this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was 
originally hugely successful in the arcades. The 
game has 3 stages, first taking you through 
Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by 
aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are 
alarmed, leaving you with limited space to 
progress through, and fire must constantly be 
dodged. 
 
Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of 
enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in 
the first part of the task. Complete this and you 
reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game 
looping with increased difficulty if you can 
survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill 
levels, while controls involve using forward to 
dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight 
simulation.

Zenji (1984) (Atari) (c) Apr, 1984 Activision, 
Inc. / Activision, Inc. 
 
Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control 
a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of 
the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is 
to turn the entire maze green by connecting each 
section of the maze to the source at the center of 
the screen. After all sections of the maze have 
been connected, you can move on to the next, more 
challenging level. In addition to having a time 
limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the 
flames and sparks which wander about the maze. 
From time to time a number will appear in a maze 
section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch 
the number before it disappears, bonus points are 
earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become 
larger, trickier and more flames will appear.

FireFight (c) Feb 24, 2003 
 
Koffi is a little kopter so when the emergencies 
came, the big kopters wouldn't let him go. But now 
he has heard that Pyro the thundercloud is using 
lightning to start fires in the forest. The fire 
needs to be put out, the animals need saving. 
Koffi wasn't allowed to help the big kopters but 
he can't just ignore this until they return. 
 
You, as Koffi, must gather water from the 
raindrops or snowflakes and destroy Pyro. You 
destroy him by bumping into him but watch out for 
his lightning. After Pyro is gone, you must hover 
close to the fire then press your button to 
release water to put out. If you don't have enough 
water, grab more raindrops or snowflakes but don't 
delay or the fire will rage out of control. You 
can get bonus points by shoving the animal under 
the trees off the screen. The forest areas are 
mountain valley, coniferous forest and windy 
vines, where you have to watch that you are not 
blown into lightning. After you clear the three 
forest areas, you must face Pyro's mom, and she is 
not happy that you beat up on her son. You kill 
her the same way as her son but she throws longer 
and faster lightning and there is an angry cloud 
moving up and down and slowly towards you. Once 
she is dead, you restart mountain valley at a 
harder level.
