Description=10-Yard Fight is a simple arcade game based on American football. One player can play against the computer or a second player head-to-head matchup and can choose between five levels of difficulty (high school, college, pro, playoffs, and Super Bowl). If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.<br><br>Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other team. If a touchdown can't be scored, then the directional kicking system can be used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.

Description=Four Japanese high-school students were camping at the countryside, when they suddenly saw an UFO landing nearby. Before they managed to understand anything, a small pink alien with a strict-looking face came out of the space ship and announced that the end of the century is near - and something extraordinary will happen in the year 1999.<br><br>That's where the game begins. You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a Monopoly-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering "yes" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.

Description=In this game, you must help a little boy to become a baseball star. Your goal is to make it through elementary school and high school, to build up his personality (making him more attractive, etc.), and finally let him be drafted by a professional baseball team. All this is achieved through playing (alone, vs. computer, or in two-, three-, and four-player mode) a board game in which you take your hero through a series of fields. Unlike most similar games, the amount of fields you can advance is not determined by a dice roll, but by a moving power meter that you must stop at the right time in order to jump the desired amount of fields. Needless to say that those fields have very different effects on the participants. There are different stats (like stamina, charisma, etc.) that can be increased or reduced if you step on a particular field. For example, you might end up on a "eating" field, which will take you to a friend who will invite you to a dinner. This will result in increased weight, a parameter that will affect your future performance.

Description=Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. <br><br>However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br><br>Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.<br><br>The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.<br><br>Archon can be played with either one or two players.<br>The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.

Description=Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Description=This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. <br><br>The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.

Description="Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou 2" is a board game, during which you follow the lives of up to 4 characters. The game is best played as multiplayer, but you can also allow the computer to play for other characters, or create all of them on your own. In the game, you are presented with a board which is composed of tiles. A roll of dice determines the amount of steps a character will take on the board. Depending on the tile he steps on, different events will occur. If the tile is empty, a random event will happen. Other tiles are connected to a certain aspect of a person's life. For example, "learning" tiles will trigger an event that will make the character more intelligent (like studying for the school), and a tile with a "love" icon will lead to a romantic encounter and raise the love level of the character.

Description=The third game in "Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou" series follows the same principles as the first two. It is a board game that simulates the lives of up to four characters. You can create all the characters on your own, let the computer AI handle them, or play with other players. You move your character(s) through the game world (it doesn't look like a board, like in the first two games, but still works the same way). The amount of steps is determined randomly: a spinning indicator will eventually stop on one of the numbers, from 1 to 6, similar to a dice roll. Unlike the first two games, there are no special icons on the board, all you see is a usual neighborhood with houses, streets, etc. Random events will happen to your characters during their life. Most of those events will modify your character's parameters. For example, a school event will increase their knowledge, sports will raise their physical condition, etc. You'll earn or lose money depending on the event. Your characters will also meet up with each other, fall in love, and experience other events, good or bad.

Description=In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play.  On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying.  Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.

It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.<br><br>The player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each "mission" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.<br><br>Once in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.<br><br>The player must also locate an item of "historical bait," appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.

You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...<br><br>In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple  just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.

For example, the first stage has the chipmunks hopping across the tables, chairs, and counters of a restaurant, and on through the kitchen. Many enemies try to slow the player's progress. The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.

Description=Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat-racing game that lets you do more than race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre but keeps the emphasis more on maneuvering than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars in it, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low, but you should try not to run into too many walls. In order to get very far you need to make use of your power-ups which are TURBO for better acceleration; FIRE for increased firepower; SPEED for increased top-speed; MISSILE for firing missiles as well as bullets; and FORCE which makes you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You get roughly one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels each with a different objective:<br><br>(1) Race to the Finish - Shoot other boats along the way to the finish line and avoid enemies like turrets and sharks. Some boats tow power-up pods behind them that you can collect after you shoot them. It doesn't matter when you finish, and you aren't told if you get 1st or 2nd or 3rd place... it seems that the other boats are only there to get in your way. Watch for the fork in the river; choosing alternate paths takes you to the same levels of the game but in a different order.<br><br>(2) Collect the Pods - Simply race in a straight path while running over ramps to collect pods and 1UP's in the air. You go on to the next level when time runs out.<br><br>(3) Dispose of Mines - There is a small square in the water with mines in it. You actually have to collect the mines and tow them to another square to make them explode. Of course, there is an invincible enemy boat that tries to steal them back from you and some guys that shoot at you. It takes awhile since you can only tow them one at a time.<br><br>(4) Fry the Monster - The 'boss' levels. You fight a sea-serpent, a crab, a shark, etc. He has his own health display right above yours, but it tends to deplete slower.<br>(BONUS) Shoot the Targets - after every boss level you go to an auto-scrolling level where you are rewarded with a 1UP prize if you manage to shoot all the targets along the shore without missing any.<br><br>(5) Guard the People - There's a large square filled with 8 helpless swimmers, and for some reason they're all about to be kidnapped. Other boats race into the square and tow them away unless you destroy their ships before they get away. You can tow the people back into the square-if you have time-while avoiding the spaceships that fire stunning missiles at you. If you have at least one swimmer left when the timer runs out then you pass.<br><br>(6) Reach the Finish - Race in a straight course with plenty of obstacles but no other boats. You drive upstream while the current drags a horde of logs and whirlpools in your direction to stop you. Occasionally some planes fly by and shoot at you. If you happen to die in this or any other level, you simply reappear on the spot as long as you have an extra life. A continue puts you back at the beginning of the level you were on.<br><br>(7) Jump the Waterfall - A level that consists of a series of moving ramps you must use to jump over huge pits. Moving currents, whirlpools, and the violation of several laws of physics makes this more difficult than it sounds.<br><br>The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels for a grand total of 25 stages. The later stages are much more difficult than the first. They're filled with additional obstacles like icebergs, more mines, more enemies, and longer courses. There are even speed-ramps that let you take small short-cuts in later racing levels.

King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.<br><br>The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. <br><br>Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.

Description=The second Super Robot War is the first canonical episode, where all the basic fundaments of the story and system are set for the rest of the series.<br><br>The story begins when a magnificent scientist discovers that Earth is being threatened, and he decides to construct the world's mightiest robot in order to combat the threat. In order to support his plan, he sets up a secret organisation called Divine Crusaders (D.C.), which embarks on a conquest of the entire planet. Only a few heroic robot pilots from popular animated TV series stand in the way of D.C.<br><br>SRW 2 is a turn-based strategy game played on a map. What sets it apart from typical war games is the fact that each of your unit is unique, with a unique personality and traits which directly control the outcome of the story. The story is told through scripted events in the scenario and through dialogue between and during battles. This makes the game as much an RPG game as a strategy game. All battles are illustrated using small animated sequences with the robots drawn in a cutesy super-deformed style.<br><br>Each side takes turn in the game to move units and fight. Each unit has a different movement value, altered by the terrain it is moving in (unless the unit is airbourne). When a unit is moved within range of an enemy, it can usually attack, though certain attacks are not available directly after moving. Weapons vary in usefulness against airbourne, ground-based or submarine units, and also have varying levels of accuracy, which is weighed against the reaction time of the target. Each unit has two different weapons, usually a remote weapon such as a gun and a hand-to-hand combat weapon such as fists or swords. Certain units trade a weapon for the ability to repair others. Another special unit is White Base, the flying carrier. Robots may enter the carrier to be carried over larger distances while being repaired at the same time and launched directly into a confrontation. White Base is both heavily armoured and in possession of weapons with a long range.<br><br>The most apparent difference between Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen and its forerunner is that the robots themselves are not sentient, instead their pilots are in charge. This opens up for a long narrative with the different personality types discussing the events they experience. The spiritual power system, while already introduced in the first game, is now available to all pilots. The spiritual commands allow pilots to upgrade their dodging, accuracy, movement or health during one turn, or even to repair other units. Instead of attacking, units can also try to negotiate with the enemy in order to get him or her to change sides. This command is mostly useful to those who have seen the original TV series and therefore know who are supposed to switch sides.<br><br>For the first time, SRW 2 features Winkey Soft's original characters, from the Lord of Elemental universe, in addition to those licenced from Gundam (0079, Z, ZZ, F91), Mazinger (Z, Great Mazinger, Grendizer) and Getter Robo (G).

Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.<br><br>The third mode is Aerobics Studios.

Description=Deja Vu was the first game ever made by ICOM, the makers of such famous adventure games as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. <br><br>In Deja Vu your character wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who you are or what you're doing there. To make matters worse, you soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegatable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.<br><br>In 1991 a remake of this game was made for Windows 3.x, featuring improved graphics etc.

Description=A role-playing game for the NES set within the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos that has spawned games on nearly every platform imaginable.  A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.

Description=John McClain decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on 30th floor, along with a bunch of other hostages. The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.<br><br>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost. <br><br>One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.<br><br>The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game ends.<br><br>Like its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions are taken.

As the doctor's younger brother, Michael, you arrive at Dr.Chaos' mansion one day to find the place crawling with strange mutant creatures.

Description=Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.<br><br>A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.

Description=Family Circuit is a racing game for Nintendo's Family Computer (known to some as the NES), hence the name. Unlike other Nintendo racing games at the time, it has many realistic traits, removing itself from the main crop of more arcade oriented titles. The car can be customized to your heart's content, with different tires, wings and suspension and detailed engine settings for both turbo and torque.<br><br>Four racing modes are available:<br><br>1. Free run: Run any way you want around the track, getting to know both the curves and straights as well as the settings of your car.<br>2. Sprint race: Race a season in four classes  novice, B class, A class and Super A  around well-known (Fuji, Suzuka) and less well-known tracks (Family Park, Namcot-ring), competing for the first place.<br>3. Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.<br>4. Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in any class around any track.<br><br>As you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it. Some of this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide. Racing straight through an opponent with both cars undamaged is perfectly possible.

Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.<br><br>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...<br><br>Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. <br><br>In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. <br><br>Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.

The goal in each level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).<br><br>Some levels contain pipes through which Dana can go, burning jars that melt ice or moving monsters instead of flames. There are ten worlds plus five secret worlds that contain ten levels. The first nine worlds can be played in any order. The tenth level of a world usually features a special challenge like moving flames or monsters and lava that is slowly rising from the bottom.<br><br>The game also features an edit mode in which players can create their own levels.

In fact, the ships can jump right off the edge of the course and drop down (in space). If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).<br><br>A notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player (&quot;Hey!&quot;, &quot;Excuse me!&quot;, &quot;Watch it!&quot;). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.

You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.<br><br>One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.<br><br>The game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.

The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.<br><br>Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid  a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.<br><br>Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.

Description=The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.<br><br>Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of <br>isometric death await.<br><br>The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.<br><br>The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

Description=Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade differs from the two other games with the same name as it is a hybrid of various genres such as platform action, motorcycle racing, puzzle solving and even some adventure elements.<br><br>In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you play Indy's role in his search for the Holy Grail, but this time it is you who chooses which step he will take at each part of his quest. For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.<br><br>In the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.<br><br>The game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.

To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. <br><br>In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up.

Description=In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.<br><br>The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.<br><br>The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. <br><br>Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. <br><br>There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. <br><br>To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. <br><br>If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the "2nd quest", which is essentially a harder version of the game. <br><br>The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.

Description=A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.<br><br>Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.<br><br>Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. <br><br>Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.<br><br>The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.<br><br>By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).

Description=Mechanized Attack is an adaptation of an arcade shooting game where the player uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that's home to a cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and features at attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter, and an entire battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed. At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game path to pursue.<br><br>While the arcade version of Mechanized Attack had a miniature machine gun replica for the player to use, this NES adaptation attempts to reproduce the feel by allowing the player to hold down a game pad button or the Light Zapper trigger for automatic fire. Extra ammo is plentiful so be sure to fire at those power-up boxes to grab as much as you can. There are also more powerful grenades which are in much shorter supply than the bullets.

Description=In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.<br><br>Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. <br><br>Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.

It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.<br><br>Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.<br><br>How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.<br><br>Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.<br><br>Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.<br><br>The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

Description=Capcom's only 8-bit port of the Final Fight series, Mighty Final Fight follows the storyline and characters of the first Final Fight game. Mayor of Metro City Mike Haggar, his ninja friend Guy and his daughter's boyfriend, Cody learn that Haggar's daughter, Jessica,  has been kidnapped by the Mad Gear Gang whose leader has fallen in love with her, and also wants the meddling Mike Haggar to leave town. Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.

The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

This sequel continued on the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.<br><br>Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.<br><br>Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.<br><br>Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".

Description=M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.<br><br>You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.<br><br>Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.<br><br>After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.<br><br>After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.<br><br>Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. <br><br>There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:<br>- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.<br>- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.<br>- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).<br>- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.<br>- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.<br>- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.<br>- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.<br>- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.<br><br>M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. <br><br>M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.

Description=Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.<br><br>Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.<br><br>More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?

Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.<br><br>Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.

In the red-tinted "real world," players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a "sleep meter" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted "dream world," where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.<br><br>Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become "Dream Warriors" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.<br><br>Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.

Description=A year after the events of the original Ninja Gaiden, a new villain named Ashtar receives word of Jaquio's defeat. Ashtar uses this opportunity to hatch a new plan to plunge the world into darkness. The ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, hits the trail to destroy all manner of vile creatures entering the world while fighting his way to destroy Ashtar, his Dark Sword of Chaos, and whatever else is behind the evil.<br><br>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos is a fast paced, side scrolling action game in the tradition of the original Ninja Gaiden game. Ryu is a ninja who can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to vertical walls and climb up and down, which is an ability missing in the previous game. Powerups are hidden everywhere throughout the levels. These powerups include fireballs and ninja stars as before; a unique new powerup is the ninja shadow. Ryu can collect up to 2 ninja shadows that follow his every movement and use the same weapons at the same time that Ryu strikes.<br><br>Ninja Gaiden II tells its story through liberal use of cinematic scenes interspersed between the action levels. Different levels feature a variety of environmental interaction; e.g., one level has Ryu on a high mountain where snow is falling fast and the wind is blowing hard. The shifting direction of the snowfall indicates how the wind is blowing and Ryu has to fight against the breeze. In a night level, much of the environment is dark and is illuminated only sporadically by flashes of lightning.

Description=In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. <br><br>Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.<br><br>In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.<br><br>As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.<br><br>Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.<br><br>The items in this game are:<br><br>1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.<br><br>2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!<br><br>3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.<br><br>4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.<br><br>5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.<br>2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!<br><br>6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.<br><br>7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

Description=Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.<br><br>The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. <br><br>There are two scenarios available in the game: <br><br>1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.<br>The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.<br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.<br>The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. <br><br>Samurai<br>The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. <br><br>Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). <br><br>Strategy<br>The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.<br><br>The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the points necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.<br><br>Combat<br>Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.<br><br>Unit Types<br>The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:<br><br>1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; <br>Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.<br><br> <br>Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.<br><br>Tactical Combat<br>Tactical combat occurs in two different locations:<br><br>The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).<br><br>The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.<br><br>The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.

In it, players can determine the options positions (which can be changed by pressing the A and B button simultaneously), as well as the properties of the weapons. It is, for example, possible to have the laser behave like homing missiles or the homing missiles like bombs.

During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.

Description=Palamedes II can be described as "its predecessor, turned upside down". As before, your goal is to rearrange a set of dice and put them in a row for elimination. Only series of dice such as 4-4-4-4-4 or 1-2-3-4-5 can be eliminated, and depending on the series, this will result in one or several rows of dice to be eliminated from the screen. Unlike the original Palamedes, this time your character stands on top of the dice, and the growing pile of dice will crush him unless he makes the correct combinations to eliminate the pile. It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.<br><br>Two modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. <br><br>Mode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile. Due to the nature of mode 2, it can't be played alone, only in match or quest mode.

Description=Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.<br><br>This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. <br><br>In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.<br><br>The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.<br><br>Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Description=This game aims to help younger Japanese speaking children learn some English vocabulary words. The game features Popeye the Sailorman, Bluto, Olive Oyl, and Swee'Pea, plus two locations from the game Popeye. The game modes included are Word Puzzle A,  Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.<br><br>In Word Puzzle A, players first choose from one of six categories. The categories are animal, country, food, sports, science, and others. Olive Oyl will then select a word of random length from the selected category for Popeye to solve. Popeye solves the hidden word by punching letters, with the correct letters helping fill in the hidden word while incorrect guesses let Bluto knock into a suspended basket which holds Swee'Pea. If too many incorrect guesses are made Swee'Pea falls down and Popeye loses a round to Bluto. If Popeye fills in the word correctly before that happens, Popeye wins the round. Whoever (Popeye or Bluto) wins the most rounds out of ten wins Olive Oyl's love. There is also a question mark symbol, that when hit solves the puzzle automatically but also has the consequence of the player automatically losing that round.<br><br>Word Puzzle B is basically played the same way as Word Puzzle A is, with the exception that in B, the Japanese translation of that word isn't displayed in Katakana like it is in A. So mode B is meant for those who have honed their English to a higher degree. <br><br>Word Catcher is a game mode for two players. Popeye and Bluto are tasked with catching English alphabet letters which are being tossed down from Olive Oyl. They must catch the letters in the correct order, so that they will spell out a translation of one of three Japanese words that are displayed. Each correct word spelled wins the player a round. Whoever wins five rounds first wins Olive Oyl.

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...<br><br>Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop.

The Rocketeer has 6 offensive options available from the start of the game, limited only by the amount of ammunition points he has in reserve: A punch (requires no ammo points and is therefore unlimited), pistol (1 ammo point per fire), tommygun (2 ammo points), spread gun (3 ammo points), grenade (5 ammo points), and a bazooka (20 ammo points).

Your first quest as Seiya will be to obtain the magic Pegasus Cloth and to bring your friends to a tournament before your rivals steel the valuable Sagitarius Cloth.<br><br>The game is a mixture of platform action, fighting, and RPG/adventure. You travel through platformer levels, sometimes facing enemies and fighting them arcade style, jumping and punching. Boss battles are turn-based, but resemble fighting game battles: you have punching and kicking moves, and have to spend your special energy, called "cosmo", to perform them. When the enemy attack, you can choose between defending and avoiding the blows (which, naturally, doesn't always work).

Description=Another game based on the animé series Saint Seiya. The animé (and the game) tells the story of the noble Bronze Saints who have to save the goddess Athena, the only benevolent deity among the rivaling Greek gods. In the game, you control four Bronze Saints: Pegasus Seiya, Cygnus Hyoga, Dragon Shiryu, and Andromedus Shun. At specific parts of the game, you'll have to choose a specific character in order to trigger a story-related event. <br><br>The gameplay is split into platform action and RPG-like turn-based fights. During the platform sequences you travel through short levels, beating up goons who are trying to stop you, jumping and trying not to fall into the abyss. You accumulate experience points, called "Seven Senses", which you can then distribute to raise your HP or Cosmo Power. Cosmo is a kind of energy you need to perform an attack, and it decreases the more you fight. In the end of a level, a boss usually awaits you, whom you fight in turn-based style, performing punches and kicks.

You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.

Description=Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.<br><br>On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.<br><br>The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.<br><br>Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

Description=Wanpaku Graffiti is the first Splatterhouse game to appear on a home console. It is not clear how it fits in the series' timeline, but it starts with Jennifer mourning over Rick's grave (her boyfriend). Lightning strikes his grave and he is resurrected. Before she can rejoice, another bolt strikes the grave next to him and a jack-o-lantern appears. This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.<br><br>Although the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies. You can pick up candy, hamburgers and cans of soda to restore your health.

If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!)

The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.<br><br>In this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations.

Description=Radically different from other racquet sports such as tennis, badminton uses a high-drag shuttle which gives it an irregular path. In this video game adaptation, the player controls the Japanese player in a competition against five opponents: Canada, USA, UK, South Korea and China. Each match is played on best-of-five sets, played to 15 (boys) or 11 (girls) points. Four different courts can be chosen.<br><br>Along the d-pad, two buttons are used to control the player - one to swing the racquet, and other to jump. By following the shadow of the shuttle the player can position himself correctly, and then hit it in perfect timing, giving it enough power and lift to reach the opponent's side, and then (hopefully) descend out of the opponent's reach. Jumping allows the player to hit the shuttle downwards but still over the net, reducing the reaction time for a proper return drastically.

The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.<br><br>The game offers two different modes of play, "Type A" and "Type B". "Type A" is a standard endless mode, where the speed of the game increases every ten lines, with an option for the starting level when beginning the game. "Type B", on the other hand, is a race to clear 25 lines, with options for both drop speed and starting garbage. In both modes, successful play is rewarded with cute animations. There are also three different background songs to choose from.

Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.<br><br>Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.<br><br>BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.<br><br>BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.

To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges!

One day, during his training, Jake is attacked by surprise by unknown foes who kidnap Allison, his girlfriend. Then, Jake has to save her and discover what lies behind that attack.<br><br>This game is a side-scrolling one, with the basic controls common to many of those games that fall in the same category: moving, jumping and shooting.

You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.<br><br>Totally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.

Description=Dr. Evil has kidnapped the scientist Jenny Aykroyd and it's the Ultimate Stuntman's job to rescue her.<br><br>Ultimate Stuntman must fight through 7 worlds with 4 stages each and then through the final world which consists of 3 stages. The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.<br><br>The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.<br><br>Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.<br><br>The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.<br><br>The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.<br><br>In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!<br><br>The game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities.

The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.<br><br>There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.<br><br>There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions.

Description=Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise is a boardgame adaptation of the Rock Man (Mega Man) series of games. It plays somewhat similar to Monopoly in that there are the buying and selling of properties and construction of "labs", however RockBoard remains it's own unique game. Between 2 and 4 players can play, being controlled either by human players or the computer.<br><br>Choosing the number of players and one of five characters: Dr. Wily, Dr. Right, Dr. Cossack, Kalinka and Roll, players must select which of four different boards to play. Upon starting, players begin each turn by rolling the dice and moving to the appropriate position on the board. Different squares on the board trigger events which can include receiving special cards, betting on hardhat races and random events. Players typically go around and around the board, collecting money every time they pass or land on the "E Canister" start square. Some boards feature different paths for the player to choose. Players landing on property are given the opportunity to buy it or pay rent to the player that owns it. Additionally, players can elect to build a lab on the property, even if they themselves don't own it. Thus it is possible to have separate owners for the property and lab. In those cases, rent is split between the two parties. Rent becomes more expensive when it is situated next to owners of the same kind. Thus, a line of labs or a line of properties owned by the same player will connect to each other and make the rent more expensive on each. Each property can only be bought once, however labs can be upgraded through four different phases, which is done only when the player lands on the property or activates a special bonus event. Players can also "take over" a lab or property from a player at any time, however the cost in doing so is more expensive than obtaining the property from the bank. Players can use cards they have collected at the beginning of each turn, each with it's own unique effects. Additionally many boards feature a "Robot Transform" square that will change the player into one of Dr. Wily's robot masters for one complete rotation around the board. Transformations include Guts Man who will destroy labs he lands on, Shadow Man who will steal other player's cards and Dust Man who will steal the rent of properties he lands on.<br><br>Each board has a specific objective in amount of money, property and labs required to win. The first player who reaches this amount ends the game. Rankings are then displayed for all players.

Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Description=In the year 1999, the world is suddenly facing intensive natural disasters. Scientists are perplexed and decide that research on the inside of the earth is needed. To this end, an underground vehicle is constructed to explore the underworld. They call it the VZR, but the crew know it more commonly as a Wurm. Four different Wurms have already been dispatched and mysteriously disappeared, so a fifth Wurm vehicle is ready to launch crewed by the best and the brightest. Crew Chief Moby has been chosen to lead the mission, even though she has lost both her love and father on previous Wurm missions. It will be up to her and the crew to figure out this mystery and rescue the other Wurm members. There's also a matter of mysterious crystals that have been found underground...<br><br>Wurm: Journey to the Center of the Earth is a game featuring multiple sequences. The player controls the VZR vehicle, and occasionally Captain Moby when she ventures out on foot in vertically and horizontally scrolling sequences as well as a first person battle against enemy monsters. Players progress through 5 levels, in which the VZR-5 investigates the fate of the other VZRs. After the completion of each level, the player gains a crystal, which will unlock additional weapons for the VZR, mentioned below.<br><br>The VZR is controlled in both a side-scrolling sequence and a top-down vertically scrolling sequence. In the side-scrolling section, the VZR is able to change between Tank Mode and Hover Modes mode. In the top-view section, the VZR is able to change between Hover Mode and Aerial Mode. The Tank mode drives along the ground, firing in three directions and uses a drill to tear down obstacles. The Hover Mode can fly around the screen, but uses fuel constantly while doing so. Like the tank mode, It can also fire in three directions and has the drill, however the weapon can be changed to two power-ups: energy balls that fly across the screen and a wave weapon the shoots out in both directions. The Aerial Mode is a fighter jet form and sacrifices the obstacle-clearing drill for a laser weapon which bounces off of walls. In all forms, the VZR has a Life bar and a fuel bar, either of which will end the game if it runs out (though Tank mode does not use the fuel). Defeated enemies will sometimes drop fuel restore power-ups.<br><br>The VZR also engages enemy monsters in a first person shooter game. The player moves the perspective of the VZR left and right, and is able to fire the weapon. There is a "Possibility" percentage on the screen that determines when the player is able to kill the enemy creature. This possibility must reach 100% before the battle is over. In order to raise this possibility, the player can attack the monster's weak point... slowly driving it up, or the player can "talk" to crewmates on the VZR who will analyze the monster with sensors and move the the Possibility value up (or down). Players can also change between different weapons, some of which are more effective than others, all of which are fired the same way on the screen.<br><br>When Captain Moby leaves the VZR vehicle, the action changes to a side-scrolling platform game. Moby must navigate her way through a maze of different rooms, looking for the objects or persons required for her to open different locked doors. Moby's only abilities are a jump, a karate kick and a pistol. Moby has an ammo bar which determines how many times she can use her pistol, and a life bar, which ends the game if it runs out.

With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link discovers this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.<br><br>Each piece of the Triforce is in a temple guarded by a powerful monster which must be defeated. At the same time, Ganon's underlings are still around and gaining in strength and number. It is said Ganon could be brought back to life by sprinkling the blood of the one who defeated him on the ashes (Link!). <br><br>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is a hybrid action/RPG game. The gameplay alternates between a top-down view (when traveling the land) and side-scrolling perspectives (when fighting, in a temple, or town). In the top-down view, Link cannot do much except for walking: in the side-scrolling action view, however, he can fight, cast spells, collect items and talk to people. <br><br>When Link encounters an enemy in the wilderness, or enters a location which contains enemies, he can fight them with his sword. If Link is at full health, his sword can be thrown, but when he is hurt, he can only fight in melee. Link has a shield which protects him against some of the enemies' attacks if they strike the shield. Touching an enemy or getting hit by their attacks decreases Link's health. Link can replenish his health completely by encountering a fairy in the wilderness, or by using the services of a healer in a town. <br><br>Link also has a "magic" meter. He can cast spells (as long as he learned them first) if he has some magic left. Spells cost a various amount of magic. They have various effects: they cure Link, allow him to jump very high, shoot fireballs etc. Magic can be refilled by collecting blue and red jars sometimes left behind by enemies. <br><br>When Link slays an enemy, it might leave behind an item, or give Link some experience. When Link gains enough experience, he gains a level, which allows him to buy weapon power/maximum magic/maximum health upgrades for his experience points, or he can decide not to buy anything and stockpile his experience points for later use. <br><br>There are some items to be found that are necessary to get past certain points in the game. The Adventure of Link features a battery backup so games can be saved without the need for passwords.

Description=In 1999 a mysterious object crashes into the desert and a mysterious creature, Darc Seed appears. Using magnetic powers, he soon turns the people of the United States into zombies and exerts influence over various weapons and objects. Among the weapons Darc Seed claims is the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.<br><br>What makes this so unusual however is that "great head of the samurai" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.<br><br>The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with 2 difficulty settings.
