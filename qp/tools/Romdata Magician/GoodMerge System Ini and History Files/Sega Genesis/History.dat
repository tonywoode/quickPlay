16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to 
Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a 
youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who 
must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. 
Apple's only method of attack is throwing enormous 
16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and 
will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, 
these weights will bounce off each other, so the 
player must be careful to not let Apple get 
crushed himself. They are also not entirely 
unlimited, as the player can only hold five at 
once, and they must be allowed to recharge when 
Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear 
from the top of the screen in waves, through a 
randomly cycling "slots" meter, and once all slots 
and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on 
to the next stage.

An early submarine game with ten missions which

The graphics are mostly close-up views of the 
control panels but in some occasions they feature 
digitized images of surface ships and crew.

off-screen areas. They can also collect monster 
books, that will teach them to scare people. Help

Aah! Harimanada (c) Sep 03, 1993 Megasoft / SEGA 
Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Aa Harimanada is a sumo wrestling game based on 
the manga and anime created by Kei Sadayasu. As in 
the real sport, the goal is to knock the opponent 
out of the ring. However, it is not a particularly 
realistic interpretation of sumo, playing much 
like a traditional 1-vs-1 fighting game. There are 
grabs, throws, and special moves, and the player 
can also win by knockout by draining the 
opponent's stamina. There is a single-player mode 
that follows the story of protagonist Harimanada, 
as well as a versus mode for one or two players 
where any of 15 characters can be used.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in 
search of your lost family, battling out 
mysterious monsters and evading traps, and

Advanced Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in 
SystemSoft's long-running war strategy simulation 
series. This version is one of the first to 
feature a full campaign mode, and takes place 
during World War II with the player commanding the 
German Nazi army, starting with the invasion of 
Poland in 1939. Depending upon the outcome of each 
battle, different paths might be taken that can 
diverge wildly from historical fact. 
 
The game plays out on the hexagonal grid that the 
series is known for. As always, each space on the 
grid is a specific type of terrain, be it grass, 
mountains, or sea

Adventures of Batman and Robin, The (c) May, 1995 
Clockwork Tortoise Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Based on the award-winning TV series, The 
Adventures of Batman and Robin pits the player 
against the diabolical Mr. Freeze who wants to 
free Gotham with a huge ice cannon and his hired 
help of other Gotham super villains: The Joker, 
Mad Hatter, and Two-Face. The player can take the 
role of either Batman or Robin but this choice 
doesn't make a difference regarding gameplay. 
 
This is a side-scrolling action game. The player 
basically walks from left to right while fighting 
numerous foes in hand-to-hand combat. Weapons 
which are found during the levels are used to 
shoot enemies from a greater distance. These 
weapons can also be upgraded by picking up the 
corresponding symbols. 
 
There are overall four areas (one for each 
villain) with three levels each, including a film 
studio or the Gotham University. While most stages 
are typical fighting levels with occasional 3D 
effects there are also a few flying ones where the 
player uses the Batwing or a jet pack.

Adventures of Mighty Max, The (c) 1994 Ocean 
Software Ltd. / Ocean Software Ltd. 
 
The Adventures of Mighty Max is based on the TV 
cartoon Mighty Max which in turn is based on a 
series of toys. 
Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows 
you to travel across different world and to save 
people who get in trouble in other dimensions. But 
his archenemy, the demonic Skull Master, has 
recently locked all the portals Max was using for 
inter-dimensional travel. However, the Skull 
Master has kept some of the portals for himself, 
keeping there some of his destructive weapons. 
It's time to destroy those weapons and to stop 
Skull Master! 
 
This is a platform game in which you control Max 
himself or one of his two side-kicks (that doesn't 
influence the gameplay). You travel through 
several different worlds. Your goal is to find 
Skull Master's weapons, which are scattered around 
the level, and to destroy them. The levels are 
timed, and there are also plenty of enemies who 
will disturb you on your way to the goal.

include negotiating for open air routes, 
purchasing or selling aircraft, invest in branch 
offices and hotels, advertise your airline and set 
budgets. You must also pay attention to statistics 
like quarterly and annual sales reports, as well 
as city data. World events also affect your 
airline, from natural disasters to war and even 
the Olympic games, all of which will affect how 
many passengers you get. All the planes in the

After Burner II (c) 1990 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. /

Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After 
Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly 
mission after mission of shooting planes out of 
the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon 
(basically a machine gun) and a limited number of 
missiles. In some versions of the game the guns 
fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you 
come across a friendly supply plane and if you 
dock with it you can replenish your missiles. 
 
The game is viewed from behind the plane with you 
fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at 
heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, 
meaning you spend most of your time dodging and 
shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to 
deal with enemies which appear behind you.

Air Diver (c) 1990 Copya System Ltd. / Seismic

A terrorist organization led by a fanatic 
operating out of the Middle East has brought 
together a military force capable of holding the 
entire world hostage, backed by a lot of evil 
governments. The player needs to board a F-119 
stealth fighter and stay undetected while taking 
out all opposition. 
 
Although technically boarding a stealth fighter, 
no stealth elements are involved. After choosing 
one from the different locations on the map, the 
player is shown flying from a first-person cockpit 
perspective and enemies do not seem to have 
trouble locating the player's aircraft. In 
different solo missions the player needs to take 
out all opposition using regular bullets and 
lock-on missiles. All statistics, including the 
remaining time before running out of fuel and the 
enemies on the radar, are shown in the cockpit 
HUD. The craft is able to move left and right, and 
use a boost to do sideways rolls or complete loops 
to get behind enemies. Some shots can be taken, 
leading to body damage, but incoming missiles are 
usually fatal and those need to be shot or 
avoided. Next to regular enemies, there are also a 
few boss planes. Missions take place all over the 
world during different times of day.

Alien Storm (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA 
of America, Inc. 
 
The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the 
"Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their 
creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and 
Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons 
and special attacks. 
 
When you start the game, you can select any one of 
these characters to play as. There are six 
missions to complete (eight in the Genesis 
version) with several stages, and each mission has 
you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from 
the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet 
the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting 
these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get 
tougher in every mission, and are capable of 
hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, 
trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission 
has an objective such as rescuing people 
destroying an UFO. 
 
When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will 
appear, which you can shoot to collect life or 
energy (by the way, life is important to you, 
since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, 
rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can 
use the special attacks that are enough to kill 
aliens you currently see. These types of attack 
vary depending on the character you choose at the 
start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a 
U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the 
street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of 
his present location, and leave a series of bombs 
that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then 
re-appear. However, using your character's special 
attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have 
little or no energy, you can't use it. 
 
At the end of some missions is an alien boss, 
which you must destroy in order to complete the 
mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have 
to enter buildings where you participate in a 
shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens 
popping up from several locations with the 
building. 
 
You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with 
another person.

Alisia Dragoon (c) Mar, 1992 Game Arts Co., Ltd. / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this 
fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an 
evil demon and avenge her fathers death through 
eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose 
of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is 
auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. 
However, the game is quite hard as the levels are 
loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using 
thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you 
often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully 
charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast 
of lightning across the screen. 
 
During the game, you can improve your magic by 
picking up potions. There are also four monsters 
which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O'Fire, 
Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has 
different abilities, deciding which, if any, to 
use in a given situation is part of the challenge. 
These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully 
upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if 
weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a 
reviving power-up. You can pause the game and 
select your companion at any time.

In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised 
from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his 
daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by 
Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead 
and demons, with a boss at the end of each level 
until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl 
captive. 
 
The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. 
In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls 
by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to 
mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a 
dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on 
the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes 
with special abilities such as flight and powerful 
attacks, easily superseding the basic set of 
punches and kicks in your human form. 
 
The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in

A game endorsed by the American player who stunned 
the tennis world in the early 90s with his "Image

and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes 
eight players (male and female and as as expected, 
only Agassi is a real player) rated according to 
movement speed and both accuracy and strength on 
serve, backhand and forehand. 
 
Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, 
passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand 
and forehand plays, but unlike other games, 
precise positioning and timing are crucial to 
avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging 
the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let 
the ball hit you on the head. 
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor 
(Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the 
differences between them are minimal. Game modes 
change according to the version, with the 16-bit 
versions including a "Skins" game, where each 
point is worth a sum of money based on the number 
of times the ball was hit.

Aquatic Games - Starring James Pond, The (c) 1993 
Millennium Interactive Ltd.|Vectordean Ltd. /

Conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly 
as a stop-gap for James Pond fans (the third 
platform title in the series (Operation Starfish) 
was in the process of being heavily delayed, 
eventually being released in 1994), this game saw 
Pond and friends competing in the underwater 
Olympics. 
 
Most events had some sort of twist to them, to 
make them fit the underwater theme, or the style 
of humour seen in the James Pond series. The 
100-metre-splash is similar to joystick-waggling 
games of the 80s but also involves making timed 
jumps to hit seagulls. More unusual is Kipper 
Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach 
balls away from a troop of sleeping seals. There's 
also gymnastics, unicycle-riding, and a hurdles 
race of sorts. The events can be played by up to 4 
players.

Pete Sampras, John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg) plus 
a few others from the Senior Tour (among six 
others, legends such as Ilie Nastase and Stan 
Smith), as well as the option to create four 
players that can be developed in the ATP Tour 
mode. Each player has seven attributes that define 
their  control and power in both serve, forehand 
and backhand, as well as their footwork. Four 
court types are available which affect the speed 
and bounce of the ball in different ways, and 11 
real ATP tournaments are available to play. 
 
There are three game modes: Exhibition match, 
Exhibition Tournament (where the player competes 
in a 32-player tournament), ATP Senior Tour Event 
(where the player chooses one of the retired 
players and competes in a 8-player tournament) and 
the ATP Tour, where it's possible to create a 
player and develop his skills by winning (or 
simply doing well) on tournaments, with one extra 
point on each round won. 
 
Gameplay uses a simple 3-button layout, where the 
A button lobs the ball, B performs a controlled 
passing shot and C allows the fastest top spin 
shots, with the directional pad affecting the 
direction and depth of the shot.

If anyone is wondering what the AWS in this title 
means, it is an acronym for Asciiware World 
Sports. Now with that out of the way, this is a 
soccer game with training, exhibition, and 
tournament modes. 
 
Training lets the players team practice without an 
opposing team on the field. Exhibition is the 
basic one team versus another for one game. The 
tournament mode is divided into two different 
modes

Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II (c) 1992 SEGA 
Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, 
as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so 
he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to 
the classic arcade racing game. As before, the 
action is viewed from within the cockpit, but 
depicted using sprites rather than polygons. 
 
There are three main modes: 
 
1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship 
   circuits with a preliminary race followed by 
   three laps. 
 
2. World Championship: The full 16-race 
   championship. There are two modes in the 
   championship mode that affect how the game is 
   played. Beginner is a regular season, with the 
   same difficulty level as the remaining modes, 
   and cars have roughly the same power. Each race 
   has three laps. In Master things get a twist. 
   There are five groups of cars, and the player 
   starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To 
   climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the 
   title the player must challenge a driver from 
   other team and beat him to the top spot. The 
   winner of this particular race gets (or holds) 
   the fastest car. Races are also longer in this 
   mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if 
   the player knocks on too many objects or other 
   cars frequently. 
 
3. Free Practice: This allows the player to 
   drive on any race without caring for 
   championship positions. There are two options 
   in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player 
   against the clock and Image Training is a race, 
   but instead of having to quality and then run 
   the three laps, the player can set the number 
   of laps (between one and six), starting 
   position and the condition of the track (dry or 
   wet, only on some circuits). 
 
While each mode presents it's own variations, the 
core of each race is the same: Along controller 
setup options, the player can choose between an 
Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, 
and races against 16 drivers. The car can be 
instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against 
a roadside object.

A Ressha de Gyoukou MD (c) Apr 10, 1992 Artdink 
Corporation / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
A Ressha de Ikou MD is a real-time railroad 
simulation game, and part of the A-Train series 
from Artdink. Based on the first two games in the 
series, in each scenario the player must use the 
resources at hand to build a railroad connecting 
from one end of a map to the other. During the 
day, the titular "A-Train" can be controlled, by 
which the player can build tracks and stations. 
During the night, train schedules can be modified. 
As the player builds, development will spring up 
around the tracks and stations, bringing in income 
by which more tracks and stations can be built. 
 
The game offers a total of five different 
scenarios of increasing difficulty, ranging from a 
practice scenario for beginners to very difficult 
scenarios for experienced players. There are also 
three different game speed settings available.

Back to the Future Part III (c) 1991 Probe 
Software Ltd. / Arena Entertainment 
 
Back to the Future III is a collection of four 
arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have 
traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and 
they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad 
Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to 
return to the present. This game takes four scenes 
from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III 
and turns them into arcade sequences: 
 
1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in 
   an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school 
   teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, 
   jumping and shooting alternates between a 
   side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. 
 
2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A 
   classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by 
   hidden extras and bonus targets. 
 
3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They 
   have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an 
   isometric version of the shooting gallery, only 
   with ammo. And the targets shoot back. 
 
4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling 
   beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking 
   and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and 
   collect speed logs to push the engine to a 
   magic 88 mph.

Barbie Super Model (c) 1993 Tahoe Software 
Productions / Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc. 
 
Help Barbie become a great fashion model!  This is 
an arcade game with many different activities to 
participate in. 
 
In each level, Barbie starts by going left to 
right with forced scrolling.  She has a default 
speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid 
moving obstacles by moving up and down and 
controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses 
a chance and it's game over if she runs out of 
chances.  She must pick up items which grant point 
bonuses and extra chances. 
 
There is also a camera item to pick up which 
brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are 
shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which 
is themed to the level.  You must then go to her 
dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  
You are also given separate control of the colors 
of three different components and must match 
these.  You are awarded points for each correct 
match. 
 
When you reach the right side of the level, you 
are given a runway practice.  This consists of 
four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell 
you which button you must press at each one. 
 
Barbie then goes back through the level 
right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a 
handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another 
magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror 
where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, 
eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  
Again, you are awarded points for each item which 
you get correct. 
 
When you reach the left side of the level, you 
must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were 
given earlier.  You are awarded points for each 
station at which you perform the correct move. 
 
Barbie then continues to the next level.  There 
are a total of four: Barbie driving down the 
street, skating on the beach, walking through a 
ski resort and walking through the park.

Barbie Vacation Adventure (c) 1994 Software 
Creations Ltd. / Hi Tech Entertainment 
 
In Barbie Vacation Adventure, Barbie, along with 
her friend Midge in two-player mode, travels 
around the country to four different vacation 
spots, each with its own set of mini games. 
 
In Iowa, at a county fair, Barbie must catch an 
escaped pig by walking up to it and pressing the 
action button, after that she can play carnival 
games.  The options are a strength test, knocking 
down cans and a hit-the clown game.  In the latter 
two, players can  aim balls with the d-pad, then 
throw with the action button.  Leading targets is 
required.  The strength test has a mater that goes 
up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the 
indicator is on the bell to ring it. 
 
In Wyoming, Barbie goes camping.  First, she must 
assemble her tent.  This is essentially a jigsaw 
puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to 
get to the other side of the park where she can go 
on a nature hike.  In the next segment, players 
aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks 
along the path and hit the action button to take 
photos.  This requires good reaction time. 
 
There's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride 
horses.  The horse runs on its own.  The player 
pushes the action button to make it jump.  There 
are numerous gates on the course and the player 
must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If they 
hit too many, they must start over.  There is also 
the option to play horseshoes.  The cursor moves 
about erratically and you must press the action 
button when it passes over the stake. 
 
In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against 
Midge.  This game allows both players to play 
simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and 
Midge can move forward or backward on the court 
and hit action to set the ball.  First one to ten 
points wins.  There is also a diving segment where 
barbies must navigate an underwater maze to 
collect sunken treasure. It might remind some 
people of Barbie's Ocean Discovery. 
 
Finally, there is Barbie's home in California.  
Ken has hidden presents around the house and 
Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.

to find. You can only jump in the game when there 
are higher platforms to access. Despite being a 
platformer, this is not an action game, since 
Barney can't die and there is no quick reaction

Bass Masters Classics (c) 1995 Black Pearl

This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at 
four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large 
bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing 
tournament is over, the five largest bass that 
were caught get weighed and are compared to the 
other fisherman's catches. The one with the 
heaviest catch is the winner. 
 
The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the 
player can either go to the bait shop, practice 
pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait 
shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish 
finders, and boat engines are available for 
purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the 
player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics 
without consequence. 
 
The tournament mode is the main part of the game. 
Players start out in a fishing boat. Some of the 
factors that can affect your fishing are 
temperature, wind speed, water clarity and time of 
day. After casting the line, the game goes from an 
above the lake view to a side view of the lake 
water depths. Then it's just up to the player to 
attract the fish with the bait, and after the fish 
is caught on the hook, reel it in.

Batman (c) 1990 SunSoft / Sun Corporation of

The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game 
follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie. 
 
The game consists in six stages, four of 
side-scrolling platform action and two 
side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following 
order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, 
Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the 
Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over 
Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, 
where Batman finally faces the Joker. 
 
Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, 
slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) 
or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B 
button, Batman will block projectile-based 
attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing 
the C button a second time while ascending) to 
leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To 
reach higher platforms, Batman can use his 
Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C 
again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or 
the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan 
Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A 
button). 
 
Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman 
emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin 
Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), 
Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads 
(which give him an extra life).

The Genesis title based on Batman Returns is a 
platform game in which the Dark Knight must 
traverse five action-filled levels on his way to 
confront the Penguin. 
 
Areas include the rooftops of Gotham City, Max 
Shreck's department store, the Red Triangle Circus 
and the sewers. Besides run-and-jump action, 
there's also a lot of combat in the game, as many 
of the Penguin's henchmen stand in Batman's way. 
He can knock them out with punches and kicks and a 
number of extra weapons stored in his utility 
belt. These include batarangs, which come in 
standard and self-seeking varieties, and smoke 
bombs that stun enemies for a while. In addition, 
Batman can shoot from his grappling gun and 
unleash a deadly swarm of bats towards enemies. 
All of these weapons have limited ammo, however, 
that must be collected. 
 
Other special tools Batman can use include the 
grappling hook to reach high places or swing 
across chasms, and his cape, which can be used to 
slow falls. 
 
Each of the five levels features several boss 
battles against Catwoman, the Penguin and others.

Batman - Revenge of the Joker (c) 1992 SunSoft /

The Joker lives again in SunSoft's sequel to their 
NES 
original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape 
from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must 
fight him across seven stages to restore peace to 
Gotham City. 
 
Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets 
by default. This can be upgraded with weapon 
powerups located in boxes throughout the level, 
giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every 
upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary 
attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has 
a slide useful against most enemies and some 
bosses. 
 
Boss fights introduce a system where life is 
measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. 
In these sections, Batman has significantly more 
health, and can take many more hits when rumbling 
with these stronger foes. 
 
Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, 
military base, and sewers. Two levels require you 
to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep 
pace in the background. Some levels also have 
Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short 
side-scrolling shooter. 
 
This game is one of the few Batman games that was 
not based directly on a movie or television 
series.

Battle Mania - Dai Gin Jou (c) Dec 24, 1993 Vic 
Tokai Corporation / Vic Tokai Corporation 
 
The Trouble Shooters, Mania Otorii and Maria 
Haneda, are a pair of bounty hunters who will take 
any job that involves lots of trouble and plenty 
of shooting. Their last job saw them saving the 
Crown Prince Denka from the evil military 
mastermind Don Morguestein, presumably ending his 
evil plans. However, three days later, Morguestein 
has returned once more to take revenge upon the 
Trouble Shooters. Mania and Maria, never wanting 
to miss out on the action, head off to take care 
of him once and for all. 
 
Battle Mania Daiginjo is a comical anime-themed 
scrolling shooter, and the sequel to Trouble 
Shooter. The player controls the Dirty Pair-esque 
Mania and Maria simultaneously, with Maria 
following closely behind Mania, and also able to 
turn around and fire to the rear. Unlike most 
shooters, Mania has a health meter which can be 
replenished via pickups. There are a variety of 
weapons to choose from at the start of each stage, 
and during the game, weapons can be powered up. 
There is also a screen-clearing bomb attack, but 
it must be allowed to charge back up each time it 
is used. 
 
The game includes a standard single-player mode 
with three difficulty settings. There is also a 
score attack mode which challenges the player to 
earn the most points possible in two minutes on a 
set stage.

Beast Wrestler (c) 1991 Riot / Renovation 
Products, Inc. 
 
A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric 
perspective. All beasts or dragons have two basic 
attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a 
special attack that can only be performed while a 
certain icon is displayed. During close combat, 
pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in 
a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible 
health bar, but three icons are displayed at the 
bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked 
down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once 
all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle 
arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that 
opponents can be thrown into and which can also be 
used to initiate jump attacks. 
 
There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. 
Match is a single match for one or two players, 
where several different dragons are available. 
Tournament sees the player starting out with a 
week dragon who has to fight increasingly 
difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, 
Speed and Stamina).  After every other battle, a 
shop can be visited that offers different items 
including food that increases Power, Speed or 
Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on 
other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, 
Dragons can be trained. The training consists of 
simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At 
a few points in the game, it is possible to splice 
the player's Dragon's genes which that of a 
defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.

Beauty and the Beast - Roar of the Beast (c) 1993 
Software Creations Ltd. / Sun Corporation of

Roar of the Beast is the second Genesis game based 
on the Beauty and the Beast animated film, only 
this time the player does not control Belle but 
Beast throughout the entire game. It is not a 
sequel to the first game, as both games were 
released in the same year. This title largely 
retells the story from Beast's perspective. It 
starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark 
woods with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and 
Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the castle and 
enchants all animals around it. Initially the 
beast needs to protect the magic rose against the 
creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice 
become involved, and eventually the villagers who 
invade the castle. 
 
The game takes place in Beast's castle and the 
surrounding woods. Through side-scrolling platform 
gameplay Beast can attack from three different 
stances (crouch, stand up, jump) and unleash a 
limited amount of roars that stun enemies for a 
short time. After regular levels, a sequence with 
a boss follows. There are also a few mini-games 
where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch 
rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The 
game keeps track of the player's score, based on 
defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is 
an unlimited amount of continues and the story is 
told through static, drawn cut-scenes between 
missions.

particularly skilled at shooting and sniping, are 
called to save the planet. 
 
"Body Count" is an arcade-style shooter. You shoot 
from a first person perspective at enemies that 
keep appearing on the screen. Once you have 
eliminated enough enemies, you are automatically 
transferred to the next fixed screen. On your way, 
you can pick special items that allow you to use a 
powerful all-screen attack a limited number of 
times.

Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite 
television show when the picture crackles and a 
shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on 
screen. This figure asks them to collect certain 
items that he has placed inside various buildings 
to test his security force. If they return the 
items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be 
rewarded. The two of them state that they will get 
the job done in just three minutes. However, 
little do they know that each building is packed 
with security guards who will raise the alarm if 
they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo 
and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock 
the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 
reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are 
apprehended. 
 
As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the 
treasures before leaving the ten buildings and 
shoot any security guards that get in your way. 
Remember that you are under a time limit. An 
in-game map will help you locate the treasures. 
There is a bonus stage after three buildings, 
where the object is to collect the gold bars in a 
limited amount of time without  one of the three 
spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide 
behind open doors. If you manage to get all the 
gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. 
There are three of these bonus stages, but each of 
them varies.

Bonkers (c) 1994 SEGA Interactive Development 
Division / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
The game is based on the Disney TV series of the 
same name. Bonkers is a bob-cat police officer. 
One day, he reads in a newspaper that a contest 
for the best policeman is announced. Since his 
partner is away, Bonkers decides that would be the 
best opportunity to grab the first prize. In order 
to win the contest, Bonkers has to catch four 
famous criminals. 
 
Catching each one of the criminals is a separate 
mini-game. The first one involves you running 
horizontally in a museum room and throwing 
doughnuts at thieves who are trying to steal 
valuable things. In the second one, you try to 
lock a criminal in a yard by quickly building a 
brick wall around him. In the third one, you must 
find clothes hidden in crates before a bomb 
explodes. Finally, the fourth and last game 
involves you driving a car from top-down view, 
chasing a criminal. Each mini-game also features a 
unique bonus game, which you get when you 
successfully complete three games with gradually 
advancing difficulty in a row.

Boxing Legends of the Ring lets you take control 
of eight middleweight legends of boxing, Roberto 
Duran, Tommy "Hitman" Duran, Jake "Raging Bull" La 
Motta, Rocky Graziano, "Sugar" Ray Robinson, 
"Sugar" Ray Leonard, "Marveleous" Marvin Hagler 
and James Toney.  You can either compete in an 
exhibition mode or play in career mode and become 
the greatest of all time. 
 
The set of punches in the game is pretty much 
standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever 
popular but illegal low blow.  Also, for each 
round and every knockdown you score on an 
opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot 
to the face and is almost unstoppable and 
connected right could knock out your opponent, but 
if you miss, you lose your punch for the round. 
 
There are two main displays during a fight, a 
damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing 
gloves, one on each side and as a player connects 
a punch, the glove will show a black area of where 
the glove connected and a damage meter that show's 
the two fighters faces.  As the round progresses, 
the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts 
to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and 
is the best time to land your super punch. 
 
Another feature is from round to round, your view 
will alternate, from looking over your shoulder to 
the next round and looking at yourself over your 
opponents shoulder.

Bubble and Squeak (c) 1994 Fox Williams / SunSoft 
 
Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many 
other platform games. Controlling a bald child, 
you move through a scrolling array of ledges, 
avoiding contact with nasties who release coins 
when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well. 
 
Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you 
meet Squeak and the full nature of the game 
starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be 
guided through the levels. As he can't jump as 
high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to 
wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve 
the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you 
stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an 
extra-high jump. 
 
Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - 
it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot 
more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is 
activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum 
machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back. 
 
In between the main platform levels there are 
side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place 
underwater – completing these earns bonuses.

turning him in different directions, since he 
doesn't always face the direction he is moving in. 
You can for example walk backwards, firing at the 
enemies who pursue you. Enemies include not only 
various types of gunmen, armed with rifles, 
flamethrowers, or grenade launchers, but also 
tanks and helicopters. You can blast open crates 
to find ammo and supplies. Defeated enemies also 
leave you items.

Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 
levels of combat in this innovative top-down 
action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as 
Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 
2. The characters are controlled indirectly using 
the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group 
of them by highlighting them, click the left 
button to move them to a particular spot, and the 
right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. 
You can also pick up grenades, which can be used 
to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by 
pressing both buttons at once). 
 
Each mission has a specific objective, and some 
feature vehicles such as tanks to make things 
easier. Your troops can cross water but can't 
shoot within it, so finding and controlling 
bridges is often crucial. You can use the 
arrangement of trees to find hiding places to 
shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers 
also doing so.

Captain Planet and the Planeteers (c) 1992

Children growing up in the early 90s were worried 
about impending environmental doom. The popular 
Captain Planet cartoons told them they were 
doomed, unless a superhero could be formed by a 
multinational group of youths (the Planeteers of 
the title), to take on the polluters and 
deforesters. 
 
Each of the five levels of this platform game has 
a specific mission and boss, and is undertaken by 
a specific Planeteer. These involve destroying 
hazards, shooting enemies, moving across suspended 
poles, and jumping onto ledges. 
 
You have four energy and four power units - more 
can be collected up to a limit of 8, and they will 
always be recharged to four (if necessary) when 
you reach a boss. You have an unlimited standard 
shot and a more powerful Super shot, which drains 
power.

Championship Pool (c) 1993 Bitmasters, Inc. / 
Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 
8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off 
with the BCA Regional Championship where the 
player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four 
games match. If the player loses against any of 
the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from 
the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto 
the World Championship. 
 
All of the gameplay is done from a top down view 
of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate 
location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in 
the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first 
ball that is hit is repetitively played out to 
show the path of the hit ball. With the all the 
shots there is a very small margin of error, but 
this is only notable when a long shot is played or 
a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will 
randomly play out all the possible occurrences. 
The player can also change the power and spin of 
the played shot with the ghost balls will updating 
to show the outcome of those changes. 
 
There are 4 different game modes that can be 
chosen, each with a different set of pool games. 
The different game modes and there games are: 
 
1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 
   different players in a first to four knockout 
   tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before 
   going on to the World Championship. During the 
   tournament the opponent is never actually is 
   seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is 
   the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the 
   player with a caption and then returns the 
   control to the player with some balls removed 
   and moved. This way the opponent can finish the 
   game within 4 turns regardless of if they where 
   snookered or not. 
 
2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games 
   that are played, all with one player without an 
   opponent. The games are: 
 
1. 14.1 Challenge – After the break the ball is 
   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. At that point, the player can hit any 
   ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole 
   the game is over. If there is only one ball 
   left on the table the rest of the balls are 
   re-racked and play continues. At the end score 
   is given based on the number of balls that 
   where hit in the holes. The score are tallied 
   up over 5 games to get the total score. 
 
2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is 
   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. The player must hit all the chosen 
   set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball 
   in one turn.  The score is based on how many 
   balls where hit in. 
 
3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is 
   placed anywhere at the top of the table behind 
   the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one 
   turn. The score is based on how many balls 
   where hit in. 
 
4. Equal Offence – Same as 14.1 Challenge but 
   there is only one game played. 
 
5. Three Pool – Only have 3 balls on the table. 
   Score is based on how many shots it takes to 
   get all three balls in with lower been better. 
 
6. Speed Pool – Objective is to hit all the 
   balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is 
   timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be 
   hit at any time and the player can miss the 
   shot and not be penalised (other than taking 
   longer). 
 
3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer 
   pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 
   2 to 8 human players. The games are:

   hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is 
   missed then other player plays. If there is

   are re-racked. Play continues until one of the 
   players reaches the score chosen at the start 
   of the game. 
 
9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  – Same as Nine Ball 
   except with 10 balls. 
 
10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  – Only the lowest 
    ball can be hit and the score for getting a 
    ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball 
    is 8 points). Player with the highest score at 
    the end of the game wins. 
 
11. Straight Pool (2 Players)  –  Same as 14.1 
    Continuous but the player with the highest 
    score after one game wins.

    Equal Offence in challenge mode but players 
    can take turns to beat each others score.

Similar to Chase H.Q. in some ways: same gameplay, 
same number of stages, and same objective. If you 
haven't heard of this game before, you basically 
drive on a freeway trying to catch up with five 
criminals who have committed felonies, but time is 
against you. If you catch up with the criminal's 
vehicle, you can ram into it to do some damage. If 
you do enough damage, the car malfunctions and you 
arrest the suspect. You can also use up to three 
turbo boosters that comes equipped with the car if 
you are far behind the suspect. 
 
However, what makes this game different is the 
fact that you can choose one of three vehicles to 
drive: a sports car, 4-wheel drive, and a semi 
truck, with each one of them having their 
advantages and disadvantages. For example, the 
truck may be slow in speed, but can do a massive 
amount of damage. The sports car, on the other 
hand, can perform at higher speeds, but has a poor 
attack efficiency. As well as passing cars, your 
task is made difficult by obstacles, such as 
barricades, on the freeway. Finally, some vehicles 
in the game will have someone shooting at you. And 
watch out for the helicopter that attempts to drop 
bombs on you.

Sakura. The game takes place on a board made up of 
various spaces: there are spaces which increase or 
decrease the character's money or happiness, 
spaces where the player can spend their money to 
buy things to increase their happiness, and spaces 
that trigger various events. The game ends when 
the goal has been reached a set number of times, 
and the winner is the player with the most 
happiness at the end of the game. Up to four 
players can play, with the computer taking control 
of any remaining characters.

Chiki Chiki Boys (c) Oct 16, 1992 Capcom Co., Ltd. 
/ SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
This platform-based adventure was converted from a 
Capcom arcade game, and set in the land of Alurea. 
The idyllic life of the Alurean people was 
shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and 
a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately 
his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you 
must take control of one or the other to put the 
world right. 
 
The boys have differing skills - one is more 
skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always 
armed with), the other in magic (available in 
limited amounts on each level). You collect coins 
as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop 
on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords. 
 
There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens 
and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any 
order. The first is straight platform action, the 
second involves jumping across clouds, and the 
third sees your characters swim. After those are 
completed, you must venture into the Monster 
Castle and finally slay the dragon.

Chi Chi's Pro Challenge Golf is a golf game 
featuring Juan "Chi Chi" Rodriguez. It has options 
that allow for match, stroke, and tournament play. 
The player can also choose to play against 
different levels of opponents, whose skills are 
measured on that opponent's putting, approach, and 
control abilities. 
 
The game lets the player choose whether to play on 
a US or Japanese golf course. Once out on the 
course, the player must choose which golf club to 
use, where to make contact with the ball, and 
where to aim in the direction they want the ball 
to go. Once that's decided the player fills a 
swing meter and hits the ball trying to get the 
ball into the hole.

Chuck II - Son of Chuck (c) 1993 Core Design Ltd. 
/ Virgin Games, Inc. 
 
The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a 
little while after the end of the first game.  As 
you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his 
girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  
Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now 
Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they 
have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a 
factory, where he develops great skill at carving 
automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer 
becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps 
him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad! 
 
The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the 
first game, but with some minor differences since 
you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This 
is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional 
rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, 
Junior carries a club that gives his attacks 
further reach.

Cliffhanger (c) 1993 Malibu Interactive / Sony 
Imagesoft 
 
Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the 
Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight 
thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases 
of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the 
Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, 
broken up by some mountain climbing and running 
(or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from 
avalanches. 
 
Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, 
occasionally carrying guns and knives the player 
can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of 
having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a 
cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen 
down for a fighting segment, nature again, 
fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves 
is limited, compared to other games of this type, 
and the ability to hit an enemy character is 
noticeably less accurate. 
 
The plot is identical to the film, with levels 
based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. 
Animated cutscenes move the story along on the 
cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film 
play between levels on the Sega CD.

Columns (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of 
America, Inc. 
 
Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it 
involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as 
to clear them. However, in columns they are groups 
of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which 
must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, 
either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple 
points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The 
real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line 
causes other blocks to drop so as to create other 
lines. 
 
As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 
'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove 
a particular block from the base of the pre-formed 
pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be 
determined by increasing the number of complete 
rows which are already in place.

Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with 
a difference, you're inside of a comic book and

the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch 
himself can jump, attack and use various items 
that he finds along the comic book, including his 
rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be 
used to unleash powerful techniques. 
 
The game progresses linear through each page of 
the comic book, however secret paths and alternate 
routes through the story can be discovered. At the 
end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero 
rating for how well he's progressing.

or objects on the screen (This is similar to the 
interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac 
Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the

creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling

decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish 
you can receive a password allowing you to

Crayon Shin-Chan - Arashi o Yobu Sono Ko (c) Mar 
11, 1994 
 
Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of 
noisy children: loud and inappropriate, 
infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to 
onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble 
with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive 
things to everyone he meets. Every so often, 
though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, 
but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and 
simply confound his parents further. 
 
Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called 
Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga 
and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, 
each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore 
his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He 
can enter houses to ask people for information, 
but will often end up simply insulting them. He 
must also avoid or knock over the other children 
in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards 
that he can use to assist him, which might give 
him a water pistol or refill his health. After 
finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move 
on to the next area. 
 
Also included is a minigame mode with eight 
different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing 
contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate 
search for clothing before school. The entire 
game, including the minigames, is filled with 
dialogue containing the same humor as the source 
material.

After American Football players started cheating

change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not 
by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice 
things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced 
with a 350 pound bomb. 
 
Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to 
life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real 
sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the 
bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 
'critical'. After this it will explode and 
possession will be swapped. This is prevented when 
you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or 
score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 
'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - 
the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive. 
 
Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to

vertically through the levels. Dahna fights her 
enemies using a sword, and she can jump in two 
heights, duck and crawl. Dahna has also a magic 
meter, which has several colored levels. Different 
levels of her magic will produce different magical

replenished by gathering magical orbs, dropped by 
enemy mages when killed. They will also drop 
health orbs as well. 
 
She starts the game "riding" a giant, and in other

creatures, such as a horse and a griffin. When 
riding a creature, Dahna can't use her magic 
powers. 
 
As she kills enemies and gather orbs, Dahna gains

Daze Before Christmas, The (c) 1994 Funcom Oslo 
A,S / SunSoft 
 
Christmas is a time where people get together and 
give others presents and spend all day eating 
food. But there's only one problem this year. You 
see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold 
and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and 
the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his 
house. There won't be any Christmas if Santa 
doesn't stop them. 
 
In Daze Before Christmas, you're Santa. According 
to the game's Christmas calender, you have 24 
areas to explore such as factories, workshops, 
caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty 
enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, 
helicopters, snowmen, and many others. 
Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to 
come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, 
The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse,  but also Mr. 
Weather. 
 
Santa's health is represented by five Santa hats. 
When Santa is hit by any one of his enemies, one 
hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then 
he will lose a life. He will then have to restart 
at the beginning of the area, unless he passes a 
gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore 
each area, Santa can collect presents that contain 
a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or he 
may release an elf. Santa should be careful when 
opening these presents as some of them may contain 
bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a 
spinning star, he must get it as this will take 
him to the next area. 
 
Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. 
In almost each area, Santa can get a cup of hot 
cocoa. Doing this will transform him into 
Anti-Santa, a type of Santa who wears nothing but 
white, grows Satan's horns on top of his head, is 
invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in 
which he can use to bonk enemies with. The 
Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but 
this can be changed via the Options menu. 
 
Daze acts like one of those platform games where 
you run through the level, shoot at enemies, and 
proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas 
where the gameplay changes, and these areas 
involve Santa flying through the sky in England, 
Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents 
in chimneys to score points. The game also uses a

Deadly Moves (c) 1992 System Vision / Kaneko USA, 
Ltd. 
 
You are Joe, a young American who has been 
secretly training to become a powerful fighter. 
One day, he meets an old martial artist who tells 
him he should travel all over the world to meet 
other teachers and to learn from them. During his 
travels, Joe encounters many other fighters, and 
has to become more and more skillful in order to 
prove that he is the greatest fighter in the 
world. 
 
Unlike most other fighting games, you can control 
only one character (Joe) in single-player mode. In 
two-player mode, you can choose to fight as any of 
the seven available fighters, and also choose a 
scenery. The game plays like a standard 2D 
fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you 
opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, 
since you can also take a few steps vertically.

Death and Return of Superman, The (c) 1994 
Blizzard Entertainment Inc. / SunSoft 
 
"Doomsday" is here and only Superman can stop him. 
Unfortunately in doing so he gets killed himself. 
Now four other characters emerge, each claiming to 
be the real hero. The story starts you off with 
Superman, then Steel, the Eradicator, the Cyborg, 
and Superboy. Each character has slightly varied 
moves so different strategies apply when playing 
as them. 
 
The gameplay is basically that of a standard 
beat-em-up, with the punches, throws and specials 
moves.

In the future all intergalactic disputes must be 
settled by a duel to the death. Nine galactic 
superpowers take control of the flight paths, 
leaving the Federation unable to operate. To 
regain the paths, the Federation sends in Barrett 
Jade inside a giant cyborg. He has to battle to 
death and defeat the other nine superpowers' 
contestants to regain control. 
 
Death Duel is a tactical side-scrolling 
first-person shooter. The game consists of 
different time-limited rounds against a single 
enemy. Before each game, the player can spend 
Pheelae (money) on repairs and determine what 
weapons to take into battle. Each opponent has 
specific weaknesses and they can hide behind walls 
on the battlefield. To take them out, Jade needs 
to choose the most effective weapons and target 
specific parts before he runs out of time and 
ammo. Weapons include missiles, rockets, grenades 
that slow the opponent down, a machine gun and 
more. Only three weapons can be acquired at all 
times. Between missions there are short gallery 
shooting mini-games where additional money can be 
acquired.

In this game you play as Chuck D. Head, the

Chuck looks a lot like a mummy, except he is 
missing an important part: a head.  Fortunately, 
he is equipped with a set of eyes and a weird 
punching appendage in the middle of his chest. 
 
Chuck's weird features come in handy when, one 
day, this evil guy named Max D. Cap emerges from 
the underworld.  Max quickly takes over our world, 
and only Chuck can stop him. 
 
The gameplay in Decapattack is of the 
side-scrolling platformer variety.  You play 
through several colorful worlds, collect useful 
power up potions, and deliver a beat down to the 
ugly bosses.

Demolition Man (c) 1995 Alexandria, Inc. / Acclaim 
Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie 
by the same name. As with the movie, the game 
takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. 
John Spartan is the country´s most fearsome cop 
and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in 
doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and 
both characters are sentenced to cryostasis 
rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 
30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as 
planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new 
crime spree. However in 30 years the world has 
also changed and Los Angeles has become San 
Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a 
remnant of a more violent past, police officer 
John Spartan is once again sent to capture 
Phoenix. 
 
Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with 
some levels taking place in an overhead 
perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John 
Spartan, the player will spend most of his time 
shooting endless waves of "cryocons" released upon 
the antiseptic world of the future. The standard 
weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, 
both with limited ammo. Additionally, various 
types of grenades can be collected, which are 
thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix 
appears as a boss character at the end of every 
level that is directly tied in with the movie. 
 
The Sega CD version of the game retains identical 
levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from 
the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.

Genki Co., Ltd. / Hot-B Co., Ltd. 
 
Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a

prince and a princess who loved each other. But 
the evil jealous demon named "Y" turn them both 
into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue sphere fell 
from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles 
can now push forwards, overcoming obstacles and 
defeating demons. 
 
"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by 
letting you play with two paddles. The lower one 
behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to 
prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one 
can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball 
from different angles and from different parts of 
the screen. You advance through levels by 
destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the 
level boss enemy appears.

This is one of the games based on the Dick Tracy 
movie. You are Dick Tracy, a police detective who 
enjoys a peaceful life with his wife. But his 
wife's father is murdered by a local gangster 
named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out 
for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact 
plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy 
fight his way through several levels until he 
faces his archenemy. 
 
This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. 
Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the 
sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the 
left. He can use his pistol gun to take out 
enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he 
can't approach enemies who attack from the depth 
of the screen, he can dispose of them using his 
machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick 
will punch him instead of shooting.

Dick Vitale, the famous college basketball coach

license is that the variety of offensive and

AI use are pulled from the pages of Coach Vitale's 
own playbook. 
 
The game features a 3/4 pseudo-3D perspective 
similar to that available on the SNES console in 
Mode 7. There are 32 college teams to choose from 
in four conferences, and games are played by 
official NCAA rules. Available gameplay modes 
include Single Game, 2-on-2, Slamfest (a simple 
slam-dunk contest), and Tournament. The AI can 
take control of defense, and the game can be

Donald in Maui Mallard (c) 1995 Disney 
Interactive, Inc. / Disney Interactive, Inc. 
 
Disney's Donald Duck takes the starring role in 
this sidescrolling platform game.  As the 
detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a 
long lost Idol, which has recently vanished.  
Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal 
self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy 
voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his 
adventure, he's going to need all the help he can 
get. 
 
As previously mentioned, there are two 
personalities to Maui, and as a result, two 
different sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a 
bug gun, which can fire a variety of different 
insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful 
lightning and fire bugs.  It's also possible for 
Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast 
at his enemies. 
 
Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be 
able to transform into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has 
lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  
In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, 
Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping 
and propping the staff between the walls at the 
height of his jump.  He can also hook onto duck 
heads and swing from them to reach areas he 
normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find 
Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, 
otherwise you'll run out and transform back to 
Maui Mallard.

Double Dragon 2 - The Revenge (c) Dec 20, 1991 
Technos Japan Corp. / PAL SOFT 
 
The lovely Marian was rescued from the clutches of 
the Black Warriors gang by Billy & Jimmy Lee in 
the first Double Dragon game, but now the gang has 
killed her in retaliation of their early defeat. 
The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge 
her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the 
second and final time. 
 
The original arcade version of "Double Dragon II" 
was essentially an improved version of the first 
game. In addition to offering renewed audio and 
visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy 
characters, "Double Dragon II" discarded the 
conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a 
direction-oriented attacking system similar to the 
original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. 
 
The NES version offered new stages, new moves and 
illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final 
boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, 
it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option 
to turn off the friendly fire. 
 
The Game Boy version of "Double Dragon II" is an 
English localization of a "Kunio-kun" game (the 
Japanese franchise which inspired "Renegade" and 
"River City Ransom" and has nothing to do with the 
arcade and NES versions.

Dragon Ball Z - Buyuu Retsuden (c) Mar 31, 1994 
Tose Co., Ltd. / Bandai S.A. 
 
Dragon Ball Z: L'Appel Du Destin is a fighting 
game that maintains the dual screen mode 
previously seen in the DBZ Super Butouden series 
of the SNES, which allowed you to be far from the 
opponent yet still be able to see him by having 
the screen split between the two characters. This 
is important to note, as the most damaging attack 
of the game could be just executed from far away 
of your opponent, the energy fireball projectiles. 
These special attacks also need that you have your 
KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) 
to a considerable level and the only way to block 
them is by means of a long button combination. 
 
The constitution of the characters is based 
strictly on the Freezer and Cell sagas (Son Goku 
SSJ, Son Gohan SSJ2, Piccolo, Vegeta SSJ, Future 
Trunks SSJ, Krilin, Recoome, Ginyu, Freezer, A-18 
and Perfect Cell), with special mention to Krilin, 
Ginyu and Recoome, who made here their first 
appearance in a fighting game. There are also 9 
scenarios available, all of them corresponding to 
recognizable areas of the anime itself, some also 
appearing for 2 times but in different status (ie, 
"normal" Namek and Namek "in flames").

Dragon Slayer II - The Legend of Heroes (c) Jan 
20, 1995 Nihon Falcom Corp. / SEGA Corporation 
 
Years have passed since prince Selios, the hero of 
the first game, defeated the demon god Agunija in 
the ultimate battle. Peace returned to the land of 
Iseruhasa. Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and 
they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. 
At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong 
warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher 
Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, 
until two warriors spotted strange creatures near 
the capital city. Those were... men in space 
suits! Of course, the warriors could not have 
known this and believed them to be monsters. Do 
the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, 
or are they a new threat to the kingdom? 
 
The second "Dragon Slayer" is very similar to the 
first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The 
only major difference is the fact that the enemies 
are now completely visible on screen before 
battles, so that the player can avoid fighting 
them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a 
traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat 
viewed from first-person perspective. The Genesis 
version has once again updated graphics.

Dragon Slayer - The Legend of Heroes (c) Jun 17, 
1994 Nihon Falcom Corp. / SEGA Corporation 
 
"Dragon Slayer" tells the story of a young prince 
named Selios. One day his old teacher Raiyas sends 
him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magic weapon. 
When the prince returns, he finds the house 
attacked by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek 
help in the castle of a baron, whose country has 
always been allies with theirs for a long time. 
However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and 
imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, 
but without the possibility to return he has no 
choice but to wander through the land, trying to 
find trustworthy companions who would help him to 
save his country. 
 
This is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG 
with turn-based combat viewed from first-person 
perspective (like in  Dragon Warrior games). The 
enemies are semi-random: they do appear out of 
nowhere and attack suddenly, but they are visible 
on the screen, and if you flee from a battle they 
will still be there to pursue you.

Dune - The Battle for Arrakis (c) 1994 Westwood 
Studios, Inc. / Virgin Games, Inc. 
 
Westwood Studios' real-time strategy classic Dune 
II received a major overhaul when ported to the 
Sega Genesis. While the basic concept remains the 
same, the game features all-new graphics, 
streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree as 
well as completely new levels. 
 
As in the original game, the player controls the 
troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the 
Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet 
Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of 
consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, 
constructing a base and building units to attack 
the enemy. 
 
The rather complex menu-based controls of the 
original game have been replaced by a 
context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit 
reacts according to what is below the cursor - 
either moving to a destination or attacking an 
enemy unit, for example. 
 
The tech tree has been simplified: Among other 
changes, concrete slabs are only available in the 
4x4 size, there is only one type of vehicle 
factory and the advanced units do not require an 
IX research center anymore. 
 
Finally, the progression of levels in the console 
version is strictly linear, as there is no choice 
of the next map to be played as in the original 
version.

Dynamite Headdy is a platformer... with a 
difference. You control a little character whose 
main attack comes from his disembodied head. Yes, 
years before Rayman appeared, we already had a 
hero who used detachable appendages to attack his 
enemies. 
 
Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite 
Headdy enables you to swap your head for different 
kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that 
stick on to walls. You use your head in order to 
climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab 
hold of things with it, and on certain stages of 
the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn 
the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you 
gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, 
Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer 
at heart.

the second player takes the role of the alien 
invaders.

Earthworm Jim 2 (c) 1995 Shiny Entertainment, Inc. 
/ Playmates Interactive Entertainment, Inc. 
 
An ordinary average earthworm named Jim goes about 
his normal daily life, cruising around avoiding 
crows and doing other general worm-like things. 
Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- 
high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- 
suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the 
neck ring of the suit. 
 
Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of 
the suit begin interacting with Jim's soft wormy 
flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes 
place. 
 
Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit. 
 
Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim 
jumping and running through the levels. There are 
5 weapons more than the original game to collect. 
Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and 
Psy-Crow appear.

Ecco Jr. (c) 1995 Novotrade International, Inc. / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Ecco Jr. is a prequel to Ecco the Dolphin, set 
during his childhood. Together with his friends 
Tara the Whale and Kitney the Dolphin, Ecco goes 
looking for the legendary blue whale. Released 
after the two main Ecco games, this title is 
geared towards younger children with simplified 
gameplay, lacking the difficulty of the other Ecco 
games. The game also contains a number of 
educational facts about dolphins. 
 
Set in the same underwater world, players choose 
one of the three characters to solve a series of 
challenges. These all involve harmless exploration 
and solving small puzzles with no foes or violent 
gameplay. The characters need to use their 
abilities to locate animals, herd seahorses, 
retrieve a sea lion's lost ball, swim through 
rings and locate glyphs. After completing the main 
tasks, a large glyph needs to be located to end 
the level. The characters can be switched at any 
time during gameplay, but they all have the same 
abilities. One button is used to send out a sonar 
pulse to locate items while another boosts the 
animal. Most levels take less than a minute to 
complete and there are eighteen levels in total.

Travel through time along with Ecco the dolphin, 
in the only game that could call itself a "dolphin 
simulator". Indeed, you can do pretty much 
everything a typical dolphin does, including 
eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using 
your biological sonar and of course, jumping out 
of the water to amaze your friends. 
 
The storyline is actually deeper that one may 
think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, 
you are the only dolphin who managed to escape 
from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your 
entire pod. The five shining stars on your 
forehead show that you are the chosen one to save 
them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as 
you will have to travel through time and space 
with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the 
mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex 
Queen.

it turns out that the Vortex Queen followed it to

All the world's oceans are threatened, and

In order to restore the Asterite and finally

confront once again the tides of time, which have 
split into two possible futures, the regular one 
and the dark one dominated by the Vortex Queen. 
 
Ecco: The Tides of Time features even better

Interactive Development Division / SEGA of

From various time periods of past, present and 
future, nine fighters killed in an unjust manner 
find themselves given a second chance for life.  
An alien being, known only as the Eternal 
Champion, brings back the fighters into a 
competition for one reason: to find one among them 
worthy of being resurrected, giving them a chance 
to avert their death and tip the balance between 
good and evil. 
 
The fighters range from different eras of Earth's 
History: Larcen, the cat burglar. Jetta, the 
circus acrobat. Blade, the futuristic bounty 
hunter. Midknight, the vampiric bio-chemist. Rax, 
the cyborg. Shadow, the corporate assassin. Slash, 
the neanderthal. Trident, a Atlantean warrior. And 
Xavier, a warlock and alchemist. 
 
The game is a 2D one on one fighting title. Each 
character supports a large number of special moves 
and individual fighting styles. At the end of a 
match players have the option to unleash an 
"Overkill" on a defeated opponent, brutally 
killing the loser in a graphic manner, or the 
option to use the background itself for a stage 
kill.

Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing (c) Jan 20, 
1992 Acme Interactive, Inc. / SEGA of America, 
Inc. 
 
Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing is a boxing 
simulation.  Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, 
the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful 
approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the 
developers went for a more strategic sim. The game 
is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving 
around the ring handle by scrolling the backdrop 
and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown 
at the top of the screen. 
 
Players can either play a quick exhibition match 
or fight their way through the Career mode, using 
a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer 
ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. 
During character creation, players can choose the 
fighter's color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, 
dominant hand and stats emphasis. Between matches, 
career mode offers various exercises to assign the 
boxer to improve his stats. 
 
During the fights, besides an energy bar, the 
fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. 
This meters are images of their head and torso, 
which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, 
as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes 
totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that 
it the fighter takes some more punches on that 
area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being 
knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a 
TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain 
strength as the girl with the round sign passes 
along their sides. 
 
Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, 
hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the 
opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt 
their opponents. If by some reason the fighters 
avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss 
at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the 
fighters must keep punching each other on a 
regular basis.

boulders, walls, dirt, and other obstacles in the 
way. Some obstacles can be destroyed when moses

obstacles can be pushed out of the way, and some 
you must find a way around. You need to be careful 
when navigating around the screens, if you cause 
any boulders to fall and they land on you a life 
is lost. Also wandering about are a variety of 
enemies which can be destroyed or avoided, but 
will cost you one life if you get caught. When you 
find all the question marks and manna you need, 
the exit appears and you can move on to the 
question phase. Here you will be asked five

Exodus. Answering the questions correctly will

F1 World Championship (c) 1993 Lankhor / Domark 
Software, Inc.|Tengen Inc. 
 
F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There 
are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand 
Prix". In both of these modes you complete a 
certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select 
which circuit that you want to race on. The 
circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, 
Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. 
Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 
 
There are slight differences between the two 
modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select 
the circuit in any order that you like, whereas 
"Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car 
before starting a race. You also need to race a 
circuit in the order that they appear on the 
circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track 
if you want. 
 
F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have 
another player handy, you can compete against each 
other.

Fantasia takes place in the dream world of Mickey 
Mouse as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. 
 
Mickey must find the missing musical notes 
scattered about in four imaginary worlds.  The 
Water World, Earth World, Air World and Fire World 
are filled with magical creatures such as marching 
brooms, skipping mushrooms, jumping cactus, flying 
horses, dancing hippos and many more. 
 
The music in the worlds is straight from the 
movie, including pieces by Bach, Mussorgsky, 
Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Dukas and 
Ponchielli. 
 
Mickey must collect special items to keep up his 
strength and earn bonus points. Spell books, 
stars, crystal balls, potions and dinosaur eggs 
help him along the way. Enemies are dispatched by 
bouncing on them or casting small or large spells. 
If Mickey finds a wooden door he is led to a bonus 
area where he can collect many magical items. 
 
At the end of each level, Mickey takes the notes 
he's found back to the orchestra's conductor who 
will send him back into the world to keep 
searching if he hasn't found enough of them or 
gained enough points.

Fantastic Dizzy (c) 1993 Chameleon / Codemasters 
Software Company Limited, The 
 
The evil wizard Zaks has cast a spell on the 
peaceful Yolkfolk, and while many fell under his 
spell, others have other problems to deal with, 
including Dizzy, who saw his girlfriend Daisy 
kidnapped and taken hostage by Zaks, and it's up 
to him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and 
rescue Daisy from the top of the Cloud Castle's 
tower. 
 
The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure 
games in many ways, it was the only one to feature 
actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen 
system, the only one not to be released for the 8 
bit computers the character originated on, the 
only one to originate on a console, as well as 
featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy 
and an Operation Wolf clone. 
 
Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the 
levels, picking up objects and using them to solve 
simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of 
arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must 
be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a 
limited number of lives, the player can earn more 
by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing 
Daisy the player must capture all stars that 
unlock the gates of the tower.

This is a vertical platformer with horizontal 
wrap-around. For the entertainment of the 
futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has 
been inserted into a mechanical body with the 
promise that if you succeed in surviving through 
all the levels (there are many and they are hard), 
you will be set free. 
You start each level at the bottom, near pooling 
liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate 
peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit 
at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. 
There are many other foes that fly around, causing 
you damage and basically annoying you to spit. 
Most levels must be navigated through a series of 
keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys 
are scattered around the map and must by picked up 
and used only on the gates they match 
individually. 
Twist: You can only carry one special weapon 
(triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and 
one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at 
a time. 
This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy 
movement patterns and optimum routes. 
A unique feature is that when you die, you can 
watch a replay and take over at any point to 
continue your game. 
You can also hit the HELP button at the start of 
each level to view a map, helping you plan your 
route.

Fengshen Yingjiechuan (c) 1996 Chuanpu

"Fengshen Yingjiezhuan", translated as "The Heroic 
Legend of God-Sealing", is a Chinese strategy 
role-playing game based on a famous legend from 
the time of Shang dynasty (1766-1050 BC). Zhou was 
the name of the last emperor of the dynasty. One 
day he visited the palace of the goddess Nü Wa 
and, enchanted by her beauty, commanded his 
generals to capture her. The generals told him 
there was a mortal woman in the empire whose 
beauty matched that of Nü Wa. After prolonged 
searching the Emperor's men found the girl and 
brought her to the palace. What they did not know 
was that the girl's body was possessed by a fox 
spirit. Since she became Emperor Zhou's wife, evil 
has entered the empire. It is time for the great 
heroes of China to free the country from the 
corrupted Zhou and his possessed wife! 
 
You take control first of one of the heroes, Lin 
Yun, and gradually re-unite with the other eight. 
The game is a strategy RPG which consists of 
battles and cut scenes to advance the story. You 
can only move during battles, or travel between 
locations via a world map. During the battles, you 
move your heroes over the top-down battle field, 
attack enemies physically, defend, or use magic 
whenever enemies are in your range. You gain 
experience points every time you attack an enemy, 
so it is possible to level up in the middle of a 
battle.

The game that started the best-selling series 
licensed by football's world governing body, this 
first installment in the long running series used 
a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") 
viewpoint, previously unusual in football games 
but quickly imitated by several titles. The 
televisual presentation, one of the unique points 
of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts 
introducing the matches, was another thing making 
the game stand out from a market dominated by 
Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games. 
 
Based on international teams (with fictional 
player names), their abilities in each skill area 
rated out of 10 to give the player an overall 
impression of how good they are. The options 
available follow the standard set: fouls and 
offsides can be toggled on and off, the match 
length can be set, and if the timer operates  
continuously, or only while the ball is in play. 
Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and 
blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set 
pieces are controlled by moving a box into the 
target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed 
or kicked directly. On the tactical side, 
formations can be selected, with 5 different 
strategies also available (although not all of 
these combinations make sense) as can the team 
Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders 
and strikers cover.

FIFA International Soccer are obviously the dozens

Italy, The Netherlands, United States, Spain and 
Brazil, taking the team number tally to over 200. 
This also increased the number of competitions,

Tournament and Playoff. Also new, a battery backup 
allowed to save up to four competitions in the 
cartridge, replacing passwords. For those who want 
to settle things the fast way, a Penalty Shootout 
training mode was added. 
 
While graphically the game only received minor 
changes to the isometric sprite engine, gameplay 
feature new moves such as volley kicks and more 
detailed headers (now more effective), as well as 
general controls being more responsive 
facilitating passing play, and goalkeepers now are 
smarter when chasing balls. Set pieces also 
received a new format, and instead of just kicking

"Aiming to be the first football simulation that 
is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA 
Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of 
release. It was hailed as the first really 
successful FIFA release, and opened the way for 
yearly revisions of the concept. 
 
There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 
stand out from the crowd of other football sims. 
Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary 
at the time -- the renowned British commentator 
John Motson comments all the incidents and 
happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient 
commentary is varied, and systems with more than 
the minimum memory level get extra commentary 
phrases. 
 
The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous 
pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a 
SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system 
 
FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the 
world, ranging from the unknown players of the 
Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the 
English and Italian leagues. 59 International 
teams are also featured, and it's possible to 
match the teams you want to against each other 
through friendlies, or you can also choose to play 
domestic tournaments or International ones such as 
the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the 
composition of the various teams, you can create 
your own dream team through the custom team 
creator.

Fighting Masters is an early one-on-one fighter

cannot be used to jump directly. Instead, the 
player has to walk in a certain direction and then 
press the jump key to perform it. Although there 
are no combos available, the attack key offers 
different moves and a few special moves are 
available as well. Most of the fighting leads to 
holds from which massive damage can be inflicted 
by dropping the opponent or throwing him against 
the wall. Twelve different fighters have 
available. Aside from the moves, some are also 
faster or come with more powerful attacks. The 
game modes include matches for one or two players

Fire Mustang (c) May 31, 1991 NMK Co. Ltd. / Taito 
Corporation 
 
Fire Mustang is a fast side-scrolling shooter set 
during World War II. The player controls a P-51D 
Mustang plane through different missions, with 
many enemies on the screen at the same time and a 
large aircraft as a boss at the end of every 
mission. The Mustang has an unlimited amount of 
bullets, but one hit is sufficient to lose a life. 
There are different power-ups to collect, 
providing additional fire power and new firing 
patterns. Regardless of the power-ups, the Mustang 
shoots forward and drops bombs to the ground at 
the same time, targeting ground troops. There is a 
limited amount of forgers, large blasts damaging 
many enemies at once.

Fire Shark (c) 1990 Toaplan Co., Ltd. / DreamWorks 
 
Fire Shark takes place around a small island in 
the South Pacific.  It is a continuously-scrolling 
aerial shooter with a top-down view.  Your World 
War II era biplane has been modified to shoot 
lasers and drop powerful bombs. 
 
There are ten levels in the game in which you will 
face aerial, aquatic, and ground enemies. They all 
fire scores of missiles at you in an attempt to 
knock you from the sky. 
 
In between levels, your plane will land on a 
runway for refueling and maintenance.  You will 
receive bonus points for the number of bombs left 
in your hold and the number of lightning bolt 
icons you picked up in the prior level. 
 
There are also many power-ups available in each 
level.  Slow-moving blimps contain a power-up icon 
which is revealed after the zeppelin explodes.  
Other icons appear when various other enemies or 
buildings are destroyed.  These power-ups will 
float around the screen for several seconds. 
Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon 
upgrade or bonus points. 
 
The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide 
Shot.  As power-ups are obtained the number of 
shots per blast can increase up to 16.  The Wide 
Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually 
requires multiple hits to take an enemy down. 
 
The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a 
spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is 
the Super Fire.  It will fire continuously while 
the fire button is held.  Power-ups increase its 
beam count to 4.

original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, 
Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual 
"save the princess" or "liberate the world" kinds 
of a plot, "The Flintstones" is mainly based on 
small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, 
etc. The large levels are divided into smaller 
stages. In the end of each level there is a boss 
battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and 
hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The 
health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred 
will find many useful items, including some that 
will increase his health level.

Space Lazer: A  shooter seen from the cockpit of a 
space-ship. The player controls a crosshair and 
has to shoot increasingly difficult enemies. 
 
Whack a Clown: This game is exclusive to the 
Genesis Version and plays like 'Whac-a-Mole' only 
with clowns instead of moles. 
 
Music: 
 
Songs can be composed by choosing from several 
instruments and putting notes onto a stave. It is 
also possible to add sound effects (animal noises 
and others) or edit provided songs.

Fushigi no Umi no Nadia (c) Mar 19, 1991 Namco 
Limited / Namco Limited 
 
This is one of the several games based on the 
animé series The Secret of Blue Water. The series 
(and the game) are loosely based on the stories by 
the famous French science fiction author Jules 
Verne. The game is set in 1889, a time of great 
inventions and technology progress unseen before. 
You play as Jean, a young genius scientist. In 
Paris he meets Nadia, an African circus performer. 
Nadia wears a pendant that contains magical 
powers, and that is why the evil Gargoyle is after 
her - this pendant is just the item she needs to 
build the ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel. 
Jean will do anything to protect Nadia, and hope 
that his love to her, his adventurer spirit, and 
the power of science will eventually defeat 
Gargoyle! 
 
Unlike most Japanese adventures, "Fushigi no Umi 
no Nadia" is a top-down, third-person perspective 
game, in which you actually move your character 
around. Nadia and other friends join Jean in a 
RPG-like fashion (although there is no combat in 
the game, different characters have their own 
item-based abilities you should use at certain 
points). There are no real puzzles in the game, 
but you'll often have to use your inventory items 
to make the game progress. 
 
Not to confuse with other Fushigi no Umi no Nadia 
games (for NES, Turbo CD, etc.)!

contains 30 missions. The game includes nine 
theaters of combat such as training missions in 
the Nevada Desert, to the conflict in Panama, and

on each of these. You are armed with a cannon, 
AMRAAM long-range air-to-air missile, Sidewinder 
short-range air-to-air missile, and the Maverick 
air-to-ground missile. 
 
11 camera angles including internal and external 
views of the plane exist. To help new players 
there is a training mode, with options to disable 
crashes and automate take-off and landing. Enemy 
AI is responsive, but a targeting computer helps 
you take them out before they can do it to you. 
The game incorporates two "Director's Modes" which 
cuts away from your cockpit to highlight special 
events occurring elsewhere in the game world, like

It's the year 300x.  The Earth has been ravaged by 
careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, 
polluted wasteland.  The space terrorists, Gulfer, 
plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of 
garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, 
aren't happy about that, so they decide they have 
to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it.  
They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or 
Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, 
Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special 
weapon: the TOZ system. 
 
Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer 
themselves?  It's not exactly clear. 
 
So, we have the premise for a side scrolling 
shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ 
system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship 
around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb 
their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight 
through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and 
really large bosses.

Gain Ground is an arcade style action game with a 
bit of strategy thrown in. The goal is get all of 
the soldiers to the opposite side of the screen or 
to kill all of the enemies. Each soldier in the 
army has a unique specialization, from among 20 
types. Each soldier can attack in two different 
ways, using either a normal weapon or a special 
weapon. The strategy comes from deciding which 
soldier would do best in which situation. Some 
weapons are better at dealing with certain enemies 
and obstacles than other weapons. 
 
Players start with only three soldiers but can 
encounter other soldiers that can be rescued, by 
touching them. If the new solider survives long 
enough to reach the exit, they can be added to the 
soldier inventory. The number of possible soldier 
in a player's army is over 30 soldiers. There are 
50 stages total, divided into rounds of 10. At the 
end of each round, players encounter an enemy 
boss.

Garfield - Caught in the Act (c) 1995 SEGA 
Interactive Development Division / SEGA of

As lazy cartoon cat Garfield, you're somehow 
trapped in your TV, that's what happens with too 
much TV watching. Go and find all remote-control 
pieces to get out of that box, and check the 
fridge for a change. The player advances through 
levels and bonus rounds in his attempt to escape. 
 
Unlike most other platform games of its time, 
Garfield boasted completely unique art on each of 
its six levels, both for tile art and character 
costumes. The levels are inspired by classic 
movies, but given a Garfield twist, like 
"Catsablanca" and "The Curse of Cleofartra.

ancient and mysterious relic known as the Eye of 
Odin. 
 
When the sun sets, Goliath awakens to travel the 
world through 1,000 years of time to destroy this 
evil artifact, facing enemies ranging from 
vikings, to robotic foes such as Raptorbots, 
Spiderbots, and Waspbots. 
 
Throughout the adventure, Goliath can climb huge, 
gothic buildings to avoid enemy fire and 
projectiles, attack and claw foes in mid-air and 
on the ground, or somersault to break crumbling

General Chaos (c) Jan 13, 1994 Game Refuge Inc. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where 
the player controls a team of five soldiers in a 
limited battleground, in a classic Red (General 
Havoc, headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General 
Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The goal of the 
game is to push the frontline to the enemy 
headquarters, by winning individual battles and 
then beat them in their own capital. 
 
There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their 
weapon of choice and range of attack: the Gunner 
(machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher 
(rocket launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades 
that can be thrown over barricades), Scorcher 
(flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster 
(dynamite sticks, close range). Before each 
battle, players can choose the composition of 
their team from one out of four choices: Assault 
team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of just two 
soldiers which have different controls) and 
Demolition. 
 
Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button 
being used to fire at the nearest enemy, B to move 
to a the pointer location and C to cycle through 
soldiers. Using the commando team changes the 
controls, with the directional pad controlling a 
soldier directly, with B being used to call the 
other soldier nearby. While basic commands are 
simple, the player must deal with things such as 
distance from target and angle of attack to 
succeed. 
If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, 
they engage in a brawl (indicated by a cloud of 
dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the 
players are in direct control of the soldiers: A 
punches, B kicks and C blocks. Every downed 
soldier can can be rescued if there are enough 
medics available, earned at the end of each battle 
depending on how well the player did. 
 
Up to four players can play, cooperatively or 
against each other.

George Foreman's KO Boxing (c) 1992 Beam Software 
Pty., Ltd. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, 
this is a boxing simulation where players, taking 
the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve 
rounds against different boxers to win the 
championship title belt. 
 
Played from an third-person perspective using a 
view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, 
players can move left and right to dodge incoming 
punches, block and throw left and right punches. 
The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the 
Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown. 
 
By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch 
often becomes available, inflicting much more 
damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three 
rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is 
knocked down four times, the match is over 
(technical knock-out). The same happens when a 
boxer goes down three times in a single round 
(regular knock-out). When down, players need to 
press both punch buttons in rapid succession to 
get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy 
meter drained when punches are received. After 
being knocked down and during intermissions, some 
energy is restored. 
 
All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be 
played with two players. A password system is used 
to save the progress.

ghost, they have the ability to trap them the 
traditional way. 
 
Peter, Ray and Egon, each have different 
abilities, and can purchase weapon and life

Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the 
Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved 
Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new 
villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in 
some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul 
Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees 
the Princess' castle and her village under attack 
by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her 
beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of 
Lucifer's laser beams. 
 
Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's 
palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue 
the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And 
it won't matter whether he fights in his shining 
armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest 
Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by 
some monsters! Although the game starts with 
graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the 
first game, later levels are set in a tower, a 
mass of skeletons, and a castle. 
 
Players progress from left to right (from bottom 
to top in level 3), and have to hack down the 
aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey 
includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery 
slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by 
finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the 
five stages has its own setting and a final boss.

destruction called "maneuver cepters" have been 
developed as the primary force, but recently a 
mysterious maneuver cepter has appeared in the

"Granada", and has been destroying the weapons of 
the factions on both sides. You are this machine's 
pilot, a man by the name of Leon Todo. 
 
Granada is a free-roaming scrolling shooter. You 
control the titular maneuver cepter Granada as you 
make your way through each stage, destroying the 
enemy's weapons. You have a map that tells you 
where your targets are on the stage, and once all 
the targets have been destroyed a large boss enemy 
appears which must also be destroyed. You are 
equipped with a standard cannon, as well as a more 
powerful blaster that will actually push your 
machine backwards with the recoil. There are also 
assist pickups which will follow you and reflect 
any shots you fire at it toward the nearest 
enemies. 
 
Of special note is the fixed cannon feature. Using 
this feature, you can hold the direction of fire 
while still moving freely. The game has nine

Greatest Heavyweights of the Ring (c) 1993 Acme 
Interactive, Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Greatest Heavyweights is a boxing game featuring 
the ex heavyweight champions Evander Holyfield, 
Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Floyd 
Patterson, Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis and Jack 
Dempsey. Their likeness and real fighting style 
are simulated by the game. 
 
The game is an enhanced version of Evander 
Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing, being also played 
in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the 
ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving 
the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown at 
the top of the screen. 
 
There are three game modes: 
 
1. Exhibition: one or two players can fight a 
   single match. 
 
2. Tournament: one player chooses among the 
   eight heavyweight champs available in a 
   eight-man tournament against the remaining 
   seven. 
 
3. Career: one player creates a character who 
   starts as the #30 of the ranking, fighting his 
   way up against fictional characters. During 
   character creation, players can choose the 
   fighter's color of skin (which now includes 
   some unnatural colors such as green and blue), 
   trunks and hair, haircut, size of body and 
   stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). 
   Between matches, career mode offers various 
   exercises to assign the boxer to improve his 
   stats. After reaching the #1 in the ranking, 
   the player will be challenged by each one of 
   the eight greatest heavyweight champions. 
 
During the fights, besides an energy bar, the 
fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. 
This meters are images of their head and torso, 
which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, 
as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes 
totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that 
it the fighter takes some more punches on that 
area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being 
knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a 
TKO. During the rounds' breaks, fighters regain 
strength as the girl with the round sign passes 
along their sides. 
 
Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, 
hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the 
opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt 
their opponents. Each one of the heavyweight 
champions has his own set of personal taunts. If 
by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the 
spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the 
spectators pleased, the fighters must keep 
punching each other on a regular basis. 
 
The game plays sensibly faster than Evander 
Holyfield's, and the character animation is more 
detailed. There's a replay feature included, and 
the fights are announced by Michael Buffer's 
voice.

Great Waldo Search, The (c) 1992 Radiance Software 
/ THQ Inc. 
 
Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of 
books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is 
hidden in various pictures, before the time on the 
clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying 
glass and must click on various items for 
different effects. Finding a clock adds more time 
to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 
points to the score, etc. 
 
Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens 
containing a continuous theme. The themes are The 
Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The 
Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land 
of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing 
on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or 
playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only 
difference between the difficulties is that on 
expert there are no clock items to provide players 
with extra time. 
 
In all of the stages the player must find both 
Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo 
must be found before the scroll in order to 
complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in 
each of these stages (except for the Land of 
Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a 
small bonus stage where they collect points as 
they control the dog on a flying carpet.

Greendog - The Beached Surfer Dude (c) 1992 
Interactive Designs / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
In this game you play the role of a surfer called 
Greendog who discovers a gold pendant while out 
surfing. Unwittingly he puts the pendant on and 
discovers it wont come off. A bikini clad girl 
tells him that the pendant was made by the Aztecs 
long ago, and that they cursed it so that whoever 
wears it will be attacked by any animal that comes 
near them. Worst of all the person wearing it is 
unable to surf. The only way Greendog can lift the 
curse and remove the pendant is to find the six 
pieces of Aztec treasure and put them all together 
and the only knowledge of the whereabouts of the 
treasure is stamped on the back of the pendant. 
 
The gameplay involves you getting from the left 
end of the level to the right while fighting off 
wild animals with your trusty Frisbee and using 
your athletic skills to jump over platforms.

Grind Stormer (c) 1994 Toaplan Co., Ltd. / Tengen 
Inc. 
 
This cartridge combines two different localized 
flavours of the original arcade game. There are 
two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers 
the same levels and enemies, but have a different 
approach to how the player can use power-ups. 
 
In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling 
shooter where the screen is constantly filled with 
enemies and bullets, players have a constant, 
unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that 
include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, 
additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In 
Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast 
speed and the player can collect bombs that damage 
the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other 
variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to 
power-ups, having the player advance through a 
selection of power-ups shown on the right by 
collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are 
immediately applied. In the second mode the ship 
is much slower and the player needs to decide to 
spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save 
them to advance to seeking bullets or additional 
power. 
 
The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues 
can be set in the options. After using a continue, 
the player immediately receives a "Special" 
power-up granting four wingmen.

Growl (c) 1991 Taito Corporation / Taito America 
Corporation 
 
In the early part of the 20th century, a group of 
evil poachers recklessly hunted animals to the 
point of extinction, including lions, deers, 
elephants, eagles, and several others. 
 
Growl is a one-player game, in which you control 
one of four characters (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack) 
and you must defeat these evil poachers by dealing 
with them with your fists. However, there are 
weapons that can be found, including grenades, 
rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and 
shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them 
on the ground, so you can use these weapons 
against them. If you manage to get one of the 
guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply 
of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option 
is to pistol-whip them. 
 
Also, you can pick up crates and barrels and haul 
it at enemies to knock them down. Along the way, 
you'll encounter several cases of animal cruelty, 
such as two men whipping a lion. Stop the animal 
cruelty, and the animals will help you in your 
quest to defeat these evil poachers.

G-Loc Air Battle (c) 1992 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
  / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
The Citizens Defence Force does not trust the 
United Nations to keep a troubled 21st century 
world at peace. It confiscates a horde of planes 
and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job 
to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease 
can wait, apparently. 
 
The game is split into 8 stages, which are split 
into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which 
has a strict time limit, and a target number of 
planes to shoot down. They take place from behind 
your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ 
referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on 
player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles 
as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive 
a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes 
from red to black. 
 
Fail to complete a section in the time limit and 
you use up a continue, but the amount of planes 
previously shot down is not reset, making the 
second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you 
destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, 
and the rank reported at the end of the game 
improves – this is also dependent on the skill 
level you play at.

Hard Drivin' (c) Dec 21, 1990 Atari Games 
Corporation / Tengen Inc. 
 
Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. 
You are in control of a high-performance sports 
car. Your objective is to race around the course 
as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as 
possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra 
time to go farther. You will see traffic on the 
road both in your direction and coming down the 
opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 
 
The course has two sections: speed track, and 
stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can 
usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track 
requires you to perform several stunts such as 
jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so 
on. 
 
Crashing the car has no serious consequences and 
indeed shows a replay of your crash from a 
cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into 
the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or 
flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You 
lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and 
you get up to speed again. 
 
The home conversions retain most of the 
then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the 
force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

The ghost of a teenager seeks revenge against a 
snobbish family.  Your job is to scare them out of 
their house(s).  They can't see you so your only 
means of scaring them is by possessing various 
objects throughout the household.  For example, 
possessing a piece of furniture would cause 
something to fly out from it and possessing an 
object would make it come alive in some way or 
another.  You need to act quickly because you have 
something called "ecto" which acts as the fuel 
that allows you to roam the real world.  You're 
awarded more ecto each time a family member exists 
the room.  The more scares you did, the more ecto 
you gain.  Losing all ecto sends you to the 
underworld where you have to regain your ecto to 
full capacity in order to go back into the real 
world.

depending on how well the player defeats his 
opponents, he can trade his "standard players", 
who won't do anything spectacular (but at least 
fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only 
look different, are able to cross and backheel the

regime. 
 
You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, 
which are split into two styles of alternating 
action. In the first you must progress (initially 
purely horizontally, though later with vertical 
flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile 
environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining 
points for doing it quickly and with lots of 
energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as 
needed. 
 
Once this section is complete, you move on to 
one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. 
The early foes have far less energy than you begin 
with. As you progress through the game, you are 
awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar 
to Brutal: Paws of Fury

In the year 2998, humanity has finally reached the

the Black Nebula began to spread, threatening to 
engulf the galaxies controlled by humans. It

Mech was behind this occurrence. The Earth sends 
Captain Lancer, a skillful pilot navigating the 
powerful CNCS1 aircraft, equipped with the most 
powerful weapon: the Hellfire... 
 
This is a horizontal space shooter, with the 
traditional premise of a lone pilot traversing 
hostile areas and out-manoeuvring and/or 
destroying quick and numerous enemies. What sets 
this shooter apart from many other horizontal 
space shooters is that you choose the direction of 
your shots at any time between forward, backward, 
upward+downward and 4-way diagonal. The 4-way 
diagonal shot is usually the most effective and 
makes for some interesting gameplay setups, such 
as stationary guns you can only reach by passing 
them (while avoiding their shots) and then placing 
yourself diagonally above them. There is also a 
bomb to take out multiple enemies. The game has a 
standard set of pickups: P icons for powering the 
weapons, S icons for increasing ship speed, B 
icons for bombs, and score icons.

The premise is that two opposing forces are in 
combat with one another. Each player controls a 
jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may 
turn into a ground based soldier. These ground 
soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not affect 
bases. To take over bases scattered across the map 
(and ultimately, the enemy base), players must 
purchase new units and transport them to certain 
positions. In this way, the player acts more like 
a transport and management for different types of 
units rather than a combat character themselves. 
If the plane is ever destroyed, it restarts at the 
player's base location. As previously mentioned, a 
level is complete when either side's base is lost 
to the opposing forces.

Hit The Ice (c) 1992 Taito Corporation / Taito 
America Corporation 
 
Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey 
game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. 
Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals 
than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no 
place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While 
the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the 
opposing team's goal, each team only has three 
players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and 
it is possible to do a "super shot" which is 
strong enough to send the goalie into the net 
along with the puck. 
 
Available are exhibition and tournament modes for 
one or two players. Two players can even team up 
to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release 
also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy 
version adds a "shot race" mode where the player 
must get a certain number of goals as quickly as 
possible.

Starting in the airport, the player controls Kevin 
as he runs around New York, visiting locations 
similar to those in the film, and outwitting the 
bandits Harry and Marv, who turn up to harass him 
at almost every turn. Kevin has a variety of 
kid-friendly weaponry handy to take on his 
enemies, including baseballs, footballs, and 
slingshots.

Honoo no Toukyuuji Dodge Danpei (c) Jul 10, 1992 
SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Danpei Ichigeki is a young boy who loves 
dodgeball. Danpei's father was a famous dodgeball 
player when he was still alive, and he joins the 
Dodgeball Club at his elementary school. However, 
these kids are very serious about their dodgeball, 
and the road ahead isn't going to be easy for 
Danpei. 
 
Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of 
several based on the anime and manga created by 
Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar 
to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has 
four main players and three support players, and 
attempts to knock out the opposing team's main 
members by throwing the ball at them in various 
ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can 
also pass to teammates, and execute special power 
throws which are harder to dodge or catch. 
 
The game includes several different game modes, 
including the main story mode which follows the 
story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player 
exhibition matches. There is also a "league" mode 
which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, 
as well as a training mode where the game teaches 
the basics of how to play the game.

Hook (c) 1992 Ukiyotei Company, Ltd. / Sony 
Imagesoft 
 
In this video game adaption of the Steven 
Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of 
a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been 
kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter 
back to Neverland where he must again become Pan 
and reclaim his children. 
 
This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling 
action game, in which players must hack their way 
past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These 
include forests, icy regions, and towns which 
Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. 
Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be 
collected for special powers. When enemies are 
attacked, they simply put their hands up in 
surrender rather than dying, so as to make the 
game more child-friendly.

Your job in this action puzzler is to help

characters who must accomplish the task. The 
player can switch from person to person while 
moving the characters around each scrolling 
puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success. 
 
Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) 
on the screen, or trying to reach a specific 
destination which may require the use of objects 
you have discovered so far. Each level has a time 
limit, when time runs out the level can be

Hurricanes (c) 1994 Arc Developments / U.S. Gold 
Ltd. 
 
Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, The 
Hurricanes are the most revered team in the World 
Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat 
them in a key match - so desperate that they have 
made it hard for the team to even get to the 
stadium. Taking control of one of their star 
players, you must trek through the jungle, mines 
and a temple to get them to the stadium on time. 
 
Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 
'influence' a license of a show about brilliant 
football players. Arc Developments agreed. The 
gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon 
against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move 
across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid. 
 
In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the 
player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is 
only released when purposefully kicked, and 
replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can 
be flicked up while you are off the ground. 
 
The levels move from left to right but on several 
different vertical levels, and there is often more 
than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to 
Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be 
collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 
lives takes you back tot he last restart point - 
losing one of your continues takes you to the 
start of the world.

In the future, even the simple kids game of 
marbles is high-tech and extreme. Hyper Marbles 
takes the basic concept of the classic kids game 
-- to knock the opponent's marbles out of the 
playfield -- and gives it a futuristic sci-fi 
twist. The player directs their robotic marble 
around the field, attempting to push their 
opponents into the deadly electrified walls lining 
the arena. Aiding in this is a jet booster, which 
can cause opponents to bounce quite far, but if 
overused will overheat and must cool down before 
being used again. There are ten different arenas, 
each with different hazards like oil slicks and 
moving barriers. There is a single player mode, 
where the goal is to destroy all enemies to move 
on, as well as a two-player versus mode where the 
goal is to destroy the other player.

Immortal, The (c) 1991 Sandcastle / Electronic

The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure 
game. 
 
Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably 
kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, 
but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so 
you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its 
depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await. 
 
The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error 
game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, 
dying, solving the problem, encountering the next 
hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its 
traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating 
as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite 
cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and 
graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what 
challenge lies in the next room. 
 
The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps 
to the correct use of items

everything else the ‘moral majority’ needed a

Game. Or not, as this is a standard platform game 
with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. 
 
You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress 
through levels filled with hazards such as cars 
and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact 
with each of these loses you a limb, and once you 
have none left, contact means game over. Since the 
character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in 
any way, in practical terms you can think of these 
as hit points  especially as there are 
screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.

play that can dramatically increase the score, 
which makes the game very strategic in nature.  
Additionally, when desired, the player can get an 
oracle reading by asking a question...the question 
is answered when the player makes a very elegant 
play (4 way match). 
 
There is also a "construction set" where players 
can create their own tiles and backgrounds.  But

James Buster Douglas Knock Out Boxing (c) 1990 
Taito Corporation / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Final Blow is an action game based around the 
sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a 
sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer 
versions also include a round-robin league). 
Rounds last one minute, with a short break in 
between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to 
knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by 
gradually weakening him with a series of punches. 
You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting 
damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so 
players can be cornered, although the referee will 
intervene to break the boxers up if they become 
entangled in a stalemate position. 
 
The genesis version is not to be confused with the 
Master System game of the same name, which is 
entirely different.

sideways, although a small amount of vertical 
movement is included. On each level Pond must 
collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although 
there are usually multiple exits and lots of 
secret areas to explore. After completing each 
pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub

large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions 
for each game area: free hostages, detonate a 
structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit 
a level only after having completed the objective. 
Many missions are timed.

Jantei Monogatari (c) Mar 29, 1991 Atlus Co., Ltd. 
/ Renovation Products, Inc. 
 
A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yu 
Honjo, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. 
Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, 
Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what 
happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a 
photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, 
where the missing girl and three other students 
from the same school are playing a game of 
mahjong. 
 
Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a 
traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a 
regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of 
the unnamed private investigator, and moves from 
place to place via menus, talking to different 
characters. The investigation happens through 
playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll 
tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, 
the investigator can only speak with the three 
girls in the photo, but as he wins games of 
mahjong against them, he gains information and 
experience that allow him to find new clues and 
talk to more suspects. The investigator will need 
to play against a dozen different opponents in his 
attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped 
girl.

Jewel Master (c) Aug 29, 1991 SEGA Enterprises

As the peaceful kingdom Mythgard came close to 
being overthrown by the evil demon king Jardine 
the Mad, the Elemental Masters of the realm 
gathered to do battle. They fought Jardine until 
there was no more than four remaining. The four 
combined their powers to form the Elemental Blade 
with which the demon king could be slain. At this 
time the Jewel Master was summoned to wield the 
blade, however the blade has been lost and the 
rings of the elemental masters have been scattered 
across Mythgard, all save two. The Jewel Master 
must gather the other ten rings of the Elemental 
Masters and reclaim the blade and ultimately do 
battle with the demon king. 
 
The gameplay is based on fighting a lot of 
monsters in classic arcade platform kind of way. 
To do this you have at your disposal rings, two 
which you begin with and further more that you 
gain along the way. Each ring is of one of the 
four elements and by combining them you gain 
different effects. Rings of opposite elements 
cancel each other but you have to hands and two 
attack buttons so you can use say water on the one 
and fire on the other. The rings are also 
different in strength which further adds some 
complexity.

Joe Montana Football for the Genesis is an 
action-oriented football game starring Hall of 
Fame quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 
49'ers. Play a single game, a 2-minute drill or 
try to win the SEGA Bowl. Play against a friend or 
against the computer. 
 
Both on the offensive end as well as on the 
defensive end there are 24 predefined plays for 
you to choose from (you can't create your own). If 
you don't know which play is appropriate you can 
always choose "Joe's Play" - a hint for 
inexperienced coaches. The nature of the gameplay 
is very "arcade-like". The game doesn't have GM 
functions, players statistics, player attributes, 
substitutions or any other coaching options. Just 
choose your scheme and execute it. 
 
On the defensive side you can control any player 
you want, on the attack you control either the 
quarterback, a receiver, a running back or the 
kicker. 
 
The game doesn't have a NFL license, so you'll 
play against Detroit or Chicago instead of the 
Detroit Lions & the Chicago Bears. Joe Montana is 
the only NFL player (actually he's the only one 
with a name).

that they surrender and can be arrested. 
 
The initial levels follow the plot of the movie

to the Aspen penal colony from which he must 
escape and prove his innocence.  Following the 
fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that 
ended the film, the game continues on with levels

however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must 
defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons,

To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a

difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass

the direction where the nearest crystal is.

level with all your lives intact. 
 
This version of Jurassic Park does feature an

Each of the four Isla Sorna sites contains three 
missions. Once you have completed the three 
missions you unlock the boss mission. For a change 
in the game, the boss missions are 3D look-alike 
levels. Once the four sites are cleared you get

the first Jurassic Park game on Genesis and mostly 
looks and plays like the predecessor. It is also a 
side-scroller. 
 
In this game you play as Dr. Grant. The big 
difference with the first game is that there are 
more enemies to defeat. In addition to the 
dinosaurs you have to defeat many InGen agents. 
The reason is that they are trying to recapture 
dinosaur DNA and eggs to build a new park or an 
army of dinosaurs.

with the game retaining the same top-down view and

exhibition, playoff, and league modes are back

four players can play simultaneously, and the menu

Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle 
racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It 
includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the 
Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both 
training and Championship modes. The game is 
unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and 
teams are fictional. 
 
The game now has more polygonal roadside objects 
than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing 
for faster racing at the expense of some of the 
detail. You have the ability to turn on or off 
weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker 
and the bike has less traction). The number of 
laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there 
are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to 
how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch 
from cars to bikes.

for game speed and ball control to suit both 
novice and skilled gamers. Each of the 32 teams in 
the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring 
that no two games are alike. Each team also has 
"key players", such as Liberos and Wingers, who 
play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick 
Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and

Kid Chameleon (c) 1992 Sega Technical Institute /

Kid Chameleon is a side-scrolling platform game in 
which the main character has entered a virtual 
reality game called "Wild Side" to free the other 
kids inside that have been captured (*cuckoo*). He 
can change his shape into various other forms 
(hence the "Chameleon"). This gives him special 
abilities which must be used to pass each of the 
game's 100+ stages. 
 
An interesting point about Kid Chameleon is that 
the game has 100+ levels (most of which are very, 
very difficult) which must be played in sequence 
AND there is no save feature or password feature - 
which means completing this game would be a major 
feat of endurance (and patience).

King's Bounty (c) 1991 New World Computing, Inc. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, 
amass an army of creatures to take on the local 
baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A 
turn based game with a time limit that decreases 
depending on the skill level you play at. 
 
Depending on your allegiance, you will initially 
start with a different set of creatures, though 
the king will not mind whether you're his knight 
or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each 
with more mean creatures to control and meaner 
opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early 
will let you find and buy some mean creatures that 
will help you easily conquer prior maps. 
 
You can see all the enemies on the map and can 
literally clear the map of enemies, though random 
can appear in your castles if you leave them 
unprotected after the conquest. With each 
conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied 
by the enemy you are currently after), you will 
get a level up, after first two level-ups king 
will promote you and you'll be able to recruit 
cavalries from the castle, after four more 
promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All 
the other creatures are found outside the king's 
castle and can be recruited no matter the level, 
although your level determines the quantity of 
creatures you can find for recruitment, but take 
care of your money because if you don't have 
enough for your army's salary, they will desert or 
turn against you. 
 
There are also two artifacts per each map that 
will also uncover the map of the place holding the 
King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre 
and bring it back to the king, the game will end 
even if you happen to find it very early in the 
game. 
 
As for tougher enemies, like the final one having 
hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be 
defeated, but not by the army you can muster in 
one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back 
at the king's castle and start with almost nothing 
but your money, however, the enemy in the castle 
will be left without those creatures lost in the 
battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as 
every week the population increases.

Langrisser II (c) Aug 26, 1994 Masaya / NCS 
Corporation 
 
"Langrisser II" is a sequel to  Warsong (whose 
original title is Langrisser). The events of the 
game take place several years after those 
described in "Warsong". Gone is the benevolent 
kingdom of Baltia, and a new power has risen - the 
Rayguard Empire, led by Emperor Bernhart and his 
four generals. Recently, Bernhart ordered his army 
to attack the neighboring countries, obviously 
searching for something. This "something" might be 
none else but a legendary evil sword, that makes 
the one who wields undefeated. It is up to the 
noble knight Elwin and his friends to stop the 
Emperor! 
 
"Langrisser II" is a strategy RPG. The army is 
divided into soldier units and generals, who fight 
alone and who are usually stronger than a whole 
unit. Before the scenario begins, you must hire 
soldiers, buy weapons and items, etc. During the 
battle, if you come into contact with an enemy 
unit, an automatic battle sequence occurs. You can 
also cast healing spells on your units or 
offensive spells to hurt the enemy. 
 
The major difference between "Langrisser II" and 
its "remake",  Der Langrisser for SNES, is the 
absence of branching storyline in Genesis release.

Lawnmower Man, The (c) 1994 Sales Curve Ltd., The 
/ Time Warner Interactive, Inc. 
 
The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 
movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a 
Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame 
Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist 
working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 
5", a secret research that attempts to increase 
the intelligence of primates using psychotropic 
drugs and VR training. 
 
With his reluctance to aim the research to 
military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes 
and shoots a guard in the process he is given a 
forced vacation, and while taking notes on the 
need for experiment with a human subject, he 
notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who 
makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the 
grass (hence, the title role). The first 
experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, 
and while after an accident Angelo stopped the 
experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing 
Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for 
violent behaviour into the program and sped up the 
treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic 
powers, he starts to take revenge on those who 
abused him before he started the treatments, and 
plots to take over all computers in the world. 
 
While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is 
an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are 
platformers, the player taking control of Dr. 
Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best 
friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. 
The player can collect better weapons or data 
discs, which after collecting a number of them 
allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives 
protection against a first hit. The player visits 
several locations seen in the movie, such as the 
gas pump and the VSI headquarters. 
 
The twists of the game are true-3D level 
connectors, based on the CG sequences of the 
movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles 
(and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the 
VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, 
Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking 
a slightly different approach (Virtual World is 
seen in first person, the objective being dodging 
obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the 
exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with 
some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third 
person and requires occasional shooting of 
obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with 
plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

Lemmings (c) 1992 DMA Design Limited / Sun 
Corporation of America 
 
Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 
levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures 
simply walk blindly through the world in the hope 
of reaching safety at the end of the level - 
unfortunately these levels include steep drops, 
gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst 
other hazards. 
 
You are in control not of any individual Lemming, 
but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any 
of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection 
of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, 
including climbing, floating and bashing. You must 
click to select the appropriate function, then 
click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level 
has a different range of skills on offer, a 
different amount of Lemmings, and a different 
percentage target in order to progress.

Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (c) 1994 DMA Design 
Limited / Psygnosis Limited 
 
The sequel to one of the most famous games ever 
now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings 
have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which 
has their own landscape and their own cultural 
identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and 
Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in 
danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each 
tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble 
the Talisman from the 12 pieces. 
 
Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, 
although no more than 10 are in use on each 
screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the 
original and is perhaps the best option for 
first-time players. 
 
The others range from digging methods such as a 
scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher 
(horizontal), building skills such as a planter 
(takes time to produce the desired raise to the 
landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods 
of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater 
(the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of 
these are only subtly different to others, and 
their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 
Trainer levels where you can select any 
combination of skills and experiment. 
 
Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving 
as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply 
passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save 
all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby 
earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and 
Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back 
over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. 
 
Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch 
between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 
times in order to be unable to progress. The game 
saves your progress rather than using passwords as 
in the first game.

Liberty or Death (c) 1994 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI 
Corporation 
 
STORY 
The European Wars against Spain and France have 
been costly to the British Empire. In order to 
gain additional funds for the war effort, the 
Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies 
without representation. This act compels the New 
World colonies to protest and boycott against 
British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the 
protests, boycotts and politically instability in 
the New World sends troops to subdue any 
rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. 
This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen 
Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for 
Independence in the New World (American 
Revolutionary War). 
 
GAMEPLAY 
Choosing Sides 
In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American 
Revolutionary War, either as the "rebels" - the 
American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the 
British Royal Army. 
 
Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you 
to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief: 
 
The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or 
George Washington. 
The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage 
or William Howe. 
 
Revolutionary Politics 
Each turn you will have to balance your treasury 
for the war effort. Money is provided by each 
state. The more states that support your cause, 
the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is 
spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and 
recruiting new regiments. 
 
Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also 
command your Navy officer to "control the seas" 
which is conducting a blockade and privateering 
against enemy ships. This may result in seized 
goods that will be added to your treasury. 
 
The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death 
included everyone except the American Indians: [1] 
Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not 
yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not 
under your full control) [2] Loyalist Militia: 
Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: 
The French will support the American cause after a 
formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army: The 
Spaniards will support the American cause after a 
formal alliance is held. 
 
Revolutionary Combat 
The Top-down turned based combat introduces units 
available in the Revolutionary War: Infantry, 
Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). 
Combat near shores may also be joined by Naval 
units: Fleet and Fires Ships.

Lost Vikings, The (c) 1993 Silicon & Synapse, Inc. 
/ Interplay Productions, Inc. 
 
Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and 
Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien 
Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is 
collecting unique life forms to display in his 
gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine 
their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as 
a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big 
lizards and more. 
 
The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform 
puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character 
who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip 
switches and so on, there are three different 
characters, each with his own skills. Eric the 
Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with 
his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield 
which can block attacks, function as an air glider 
or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can 
shoot things with his arrows (including switches) 
or kill things with his sword. The player has to 
use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get 
past the increasingly difficult levels and 
puzzles. 
 
The player controls one Viking at a time, but can 
switch between them at any point. The Vikings have 
limited space in their inventory which they can 
use to keep various items. Each Viking has three 
health points, and if he loses them all from 
confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats 
kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

who battle demons and other forces of darkness who 
threaten Earth. The realm of the demons (which is 
parallel to our world) is in cross-dimensional 
alignment with our own, which could cause a portal 
to open, allowing the demons to cross over, and 
launch an all-out attack. The demons are trying to 
destroy Yoko before she can take her rightful 
place as the 108th generation Devil Hunter. She 
must stop the demons before they can perform the 
ritual that will mean the end of the human race. 
 
Mamono Hunter Yoko: Dai 7 no Keisho is a side 
scrolling action/platformer game along the lines 
of Valis. You control Yoko who is equipped with a 
sword, which you use to slash your enemies. Also 
if you hold the attack button you can create a 
shield which will block weak attacks. The shield 
can also then be thrown to attack enemies. You 
play through various different worlds, such as a 
plant type stage, a water stage, a cave stage, a 
snow stage, etc.

Man Overboard! - S.S. Lucifer (c) 1994 Odysseus 
Software / Codemasters 
 
Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner 
extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a 
sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off 
in your little submarine and board the ship where 
a horde of passengers desperately need your keen 
oversight and "shipsmarts". 
 
In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers 
(dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the 
beginning the passengers fall through a tube in 
the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a 
way for the passengers to the exit of the level. 
In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such 
cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no 
bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. 
There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If 
the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers 
either can't use it or may even be transported to 
their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or 
steam jets. You can usually choose the direction 
of the belts by pulling a lever. 
 
There are several types of scenarios that Kevin 
Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. 
Of course the puzzles get progressively more 
difficult, involving things like patching up 
cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from 
cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast 
away obstacles and stack crates in creative 
manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto 
each other to form a bridge across a gap or to 
provide shielding from fire. This is usually done 
by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a 
crane. 
 
Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you 
have to save at least a certain amount of 
passengers. This again is akin a bit towards 
Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time 
limit, represented be water pouring into the 
compartment, rising ominously. When the water 
rises high enough, the passengers will get carried 
along with it, and they can only swim for a short 
period of time before getting exhausted and 
drowning, so you'd better be on time with some 
assistance. 
 
At the end of each level you receive a password 
(again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up 
your game from the current level without having to 
progress through them all from the get-go.

Marble Madness (c) Aug, 1991 Atari Games

A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively 
simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting 
any obstacles or straying off the course. The game 
is viewed from an isometric perspective, which 
makes it harder to stay focused on the direction 
the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors 
to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 
2-player mode in which players must race to the 
finish

Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most 
successful racing drivers in the US scene, and 
five of his relatives have also raced 
professionally. This game allows you to sample 
Indy cars, stock cars and sprint cars, all of 
which have been graced by Andrettis. The physics 
are customized to each of these, so expect sprint 
cars to slide around on the dirt tracks, and the 
slipstream effect is detectable. 
 
There are 27 computer-controlled cars with 
individual profiles, and 8 cars to choose from in 
each race, with varying engine, grip, brakes and 
pit crew standards. You can view the action either 
from behind the car, or from the nose. In longer 
races you must monitor the pit strategy, with the 
options of a splash 'n' dash stop if your tires 
are still fine.

Mario Lemieux Hockey (c) 1991 Alpine Studios, Inc.

This hockey game contains an exhibition, 
tournament, shootout, and a fight mode. It also 
has 16 teams that represent the cities of real NHL 
teams but the game does not contain either real 
NHL teams or players. 
 
Exhibition mode is just a one on one matchup 
between 2 teams. 
 
In the tournament mode, a team must win to advance 
to the next round. If a team loses they are 
eliminated. 
 
The shootout mode consists of two teams  who take 
turns taking shots at the goalie and whoever 
scores the most goals 
wins. 
 
Fight mode consists of two hockey players fighting 
each other until either of their energy bars runs 
out. This mode is good to get some practice 
because when the fight happens in a hockey game 
the loser of the fight gets sent to the penalty 
box. 
 
There are three skill levels and four 
period-lengths to choose from. The game also has 
an option to make the referee either blind, fair, 
or tough which affects the frequency of penalties.

football comes in touch with the substance it gets 
magical powers, giving Marko the power to stop 
Colonel Brown. 
 
Now Marko has to find his way through numerous

Marsupilami (c) 1995 Apache Software Limited / 
SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Based on the character developed by Belgian 
cartoon artist Franquin, this platform features 
the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange 
animal with a large tail, who was poached along 
with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian 
jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. 
Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer 
fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his 
long tail and released all animals, and with the 
help of their Palombian friends Noé, Bip and Sarah 
tries to return to Palombia. 
 
While it might seem a typical platform game at 
first sight, it  includes a twist: Instead of 
dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide 
Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much 
different than the Earthworm Jim levels where Jim 
has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping 
his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but 
to do so, he must first collect an icon with the 
abilities required to complete the level, up to 
four on each. Always available is the ability to 
shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards 
and other enemies away, but also to change 
Bonelli's direction. The player also collects 
fruits along the way, which not only provide extra 
points at the end of the level, but can be dropped 
out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so 
the player can't make many mistakes, even if some 
time bonus items are occasionally available.

Marvel Land (c) 1991 Namco Limited / Namco Hometek 
Inc. 
 
In the land of Coni, its inhabitants lived in 
harmony. At its center lies a mountain called 
"Peace", in which an amusement park known as 
"Marvel Land" resides. This park is well-protected 
by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of 
the under dwellers and sent his minions to take 
over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside 
crystal balls. 
 
A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue 
Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from 
King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds 
with seven stages each, and the game plays in 
platform style, in which you need to run through 
the level, killing enemies, and find the exit 
door. More often than not, you have to go through 
a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at 
its center, you are awarded more points than you 
do by hitting it above or below. 
 
You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads 
or attacking them with clones, which trail your 
movement unless you use them to attack enemies or 
collect food. The clones have a limited life and 
disappear one by one as you use them. 
 
During the game, you can open any treasure chests 
that you may find along the way, and release 
power-ups which include boots that make you 
increase your speed, dragon wings that enable you 
to jump higher and giving you the ability to glide 
to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the 
"clone" attack. Hidden throughout the sections are 
warp doors that can either take your backwards or 
forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section 
of a world has you riding a roller coaster, in 
which you must stay on the cars while avoiding 
signs and enemies. 
 
The last section of each world has Talmit going 
through the castle to reach the end-of-world boss. 
Unlike other platform games where you must defeat 
bosses with weapons, you are challenged to various 
mini-games starting from "rock, paper, scissors" 
through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win 
one of the mini-games, you are able to free one of 
the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball that you 
need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the 
Bonus Stage where you must collect shooting stars 
for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are 
transported back to the start of the last section.

Master of Monsters (c) 1991 SystemSoft /

Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game 
in which you choose one of five different wizards 
and fight the other wizards for domination of the 
land that stands without a ruler  after the master 
wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns 
against the computer which requires you to defeat 
the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to 
take all units that have survived a battle into 
the next one. You can also play all maps 
individually with up two four human players. In 
battles, you can summon different monsters and 
cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and 
which spells you can use depends on which wizard 
you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to 
defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the 
land (In the campaigns you only have a limited 
number of turns to do so). Your wizard and 
monsters gain experience from fighting and your 
monsters' abilities differ largely from 
one-another. For example some monsters can execute 
long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks 
but are physically weak. Furthermore, their 
movement is affected by different terrain types. 
While flying monsters can move freely, most of the 
other monster have a preferred terrain type 
(lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon 
up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many 
monsters you can summon each turn is not only 
determined by the amount of MP, but also by the 
number of towers that you control, which makes 
conquering and defending towers a key-element in 
battles.

Math Blaster - Episode 1 (c) Sep 14, 1994 Western 
Technologies Inc. / Davidson & Associates, Inc. 
 
A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, 
Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational 
title with arcade elements designed to help 
students learn maths while having fun. 
 
The game allows students to practice basic 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division skills in addition to fractions, 
decimals, percents, estimation, and number 
patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately 
or together in review. Six levels of difficulty 
are provided. Like the previous titles, the game 
also includes an editor to create new problem sets 
(present in the PC version only). 
 
Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is 
kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning 
of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math 
Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to 
his home planet and rescue Spot. 
 
The game starts with a complete mission (story 
mode). The mission consists of a series of four 
(three in the console versions) math activities 
(mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The 
activities can also be played separately, for 
practice or for score. 
 
The activities are as follows: 
 
1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain 
   tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam 
   to collect space trash. 
 
2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create 
   equations by pushing around columns of numbers 
   and operators. Correct equations allow you to 
   turn the trash you collected into fuel. 
 
3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to 
   fly through a cave. He has a number on his 
   chest, and it must be arithmetically between 
   the numbers on each side of an opening in order 
   for him to pass through. Droplets of water 
   falling from above can change this number by 
   performing an operation on it. There are also 
   gems which can be collected for bonus points, 
   and in higher levels, monsters appear that can 
   knock Math Blaster down. 
 
4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship 
   displays an equation, and the four portholes 
   serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet 
   pack to fly into the correct portholes while 
   avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from 
   the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and 
   after five problems a bonus round occurs where 
   players get a chance to collect as many gems as 
   they can within a time limit. 
 
Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is 
presented with a certificate that can be printed 
out (PC version only). Their final score is also 
added to a high score board for their account.

Megapanel is a tile-based puzzle game that plays 
like a mixture of Tetris Attack and a traditional 
sliding tile puzzle. Blocks rise from the bottom 
of a well, and the player must slide them around 
in order to create a row or column of three 
same-color blocks. This causes the group to clear, 
and potentially create chains from the blocks 
above falling. As the game continues, the number 
of blocks that must be cleared to continue as well 
as the speed at which the stack rises will both 
increase. 
 
The game includes three modes. First is training 
mode which explains the basics of the game. In 
this mode, a certain number of blocks must be 
cleared to complete the stage. Second is a 
"pin-up" mode for one player, where clearing 
blocks reveals parts of an image of a cute anime 
girl, the goal being to uncover the entire 
picture. Last is a two-player versus mode, where 
players compete to clear their blocks the fastest, 
and can send garbage blocks to their opponent and 
fill up their field. The game includes two 
difficulty settings, two versus modes, a sound 
test, and a unique mode that displays the entire 
game in sepia tone.

live. 
 
Another unique feature in multiplayer is you can 
choose your character. Pick one of 9 such as 
Miner, Tiny, Fat, Cop, Punk(On cover), Lady, Old 
man, Robot and the original Bomberman. 
 
After selecting your character get ready for 
battle as you are placed in 1 of the 4 corners of 
the arena. Now just blow your way through the 
blocks and attack some opponents. Watch out for 
their bombs and remember to dodge your own. There 
are also many arena's to choose from. Each arena 
has it's own twist such as trap doors, an igloo to 
hide in, conveyor belts and more.

A secret "underground race" on an island in the 
mid-Atlantic ocean has stolen top military 
vehicles and equipment from around the world and 
have rebuilt powerful war machines from them. They 
are even piloted by robots with one mission: to 
destroy. Military and intelligence officials of 
major countries have detected them, but they are 
afraid that they will be unable to prepare against 
an assault by this underground race. Their plan is 
to send you in to infiltrate their base and 
destroy them before they have a chance to unleash 
the war upon the rest of the world. You can choose 
to control either the Helicoptor or the Jeep, 
which have different advantages -- for instance, 
the Helicoptor is not obstructed by obstacles but 
the Jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine 
weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting 
specials) you can pick up along the way to help 
you destroy the enemy.

After many generations of peace, the Dark Forces 
have assembled again, and as a member of the USS 
Freedom Forces, it is your job to defeat them once 
again. This means you will have to complete 
numerous large levels always searching for secrets 
to pick up and enemies to shoot. To do this, you 
can pick up three different, upgradeable shots: a 
multiple, a laser and a rebound. You can also go 
into wheel-mode (as long as you have enough 
special energy) or use a rope. In wheel-mode, you 
are invincible and can lay mines or explore 
previously unreachable areas.

Menacer 6-in-1 Game Pack (c) 1992 
Johnson-Voorsanger Productions|Western 
Technologies Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Menacer 6-Game Cartridge was released as a pack-in 
cartridge for the Menacer light gun. It is a 
compilation of six games: 
 
1. Pest Control: in this game the player has to 
   defend a pizza from the attack of assorted 
   bugs. The player smokes the bugs while 
   controlling a spotlight, but it is also 
   possible to see the whole table while pressing 
   a second button (in this case, it won't be 
   possible to use the insecticide). The game is 
   over when the pizza is all eaten. Different 
   bugs will appear throughout the levels, such as 
   some big ones which explode in smaller ones 
   when shot. 
 
2. Space Station Defender: the player has to 
   shoot aliens inside pods which appear on the 
   screen in a given sequence and in specific 
   positions. As the player follows the pattern, 
   he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower 
   end of the screen where "power" can be read. 
   There's also a random mode, where all pods 
   appear at the same time and the player has to 
   guess the order in which they'll open. The 
   aliens shoot back if the player takes much time 
   to shoot them. Once in a while a little flying 
   saucer will cross the screen

You run through each of the 8 levels, which 
primarily scroll horizontally, shooting everyone 
before they can shoot you. At times you will have 
to shoot trees and other scenery to progress. 
 
Finding strategic placings is important, 
especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most 
of the time you are on foot, but at times you can 
hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved 
weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to 
collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large 
vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.

Metal Fangs (c) Dec 17, 1993 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
/ Victor Entertainment Inc. 
 
Metal Fangs is a unique futuristic battle driving 
game, where the player controls a team of racers 
and must attempt to destroy the competing team. 
Each "race" is made up of two heats of two parts 
each, and hits or kills on the other team earns 
points. During each heat, each team takes one turn 
attacking (four vehicles on the course) and one 
turn defending (three vehicles on the course). The 
team with the most points at the end of the last 
heat wins a reward and moves on to the next match. 
 
However, your team won't get very far with just 
its basic equipment. After choosing your team's 
colors and members, you must then purchase 
upgrades for each person: engines, fuel, AI, 
armor, and of course weapons. During the game, you 
can switch freely between each member of your 
team. Your vehicle automatically moves forward 
around the track, but you can turn, throttle, and 
brake in order to move closer to or escape from 
the other team. 
 
After each successful match there is a game of 
chance where winnings can be increased. There is 
also a two-player simultaneous battle mode.

Mickey's Ultimate Challenge (c) 1994 Designer 
Software|WayForward Technologies / Hi-Tech 
Expressions, Inc. 
 
One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed 
reading a book of fairy tales, he started to 
wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, 
in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up 
in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly 
tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help 
to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes. 
 
Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in 
which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie 
to play with. They'll find five characters from 
the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be 
prompted to help them in several tasks. 
 
Each task is a different puzzle, given by a 
specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask 
help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a 
wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where 
Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching 
pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive 
a gift. 
 
After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must 
trade the gifts they won with the right 
characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's 
task, they will receive his hammer. The player 
must then guess who among the other characters 
would like to receive that hammer. 
 
Giving the right items to the right characters 
will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last 
puzzle and character.

Micro Machines (c) 1993 Codemasters Software

If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally 
cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, 
the Micro Machines series could be for you. It 
involves racing miniatures representing particular 
vehicle types across a particular terrain found 
around the house. The Sports Cars race on the 
desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a 
snooker table, and so on. 
 
These levels were packed with variation. The 
Snooker tables has the track painted on, although 
this is open to deviation (as are most levels), 
and had you racing through the pockets and across 
the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with 
the chance of shooting out your opponent if they 
got directly in front of you. The desktop levels 
include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners 
to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open 
homework. 
 
Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the 
races include up to 4 cars. In one player 
challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a 
set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go 
along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally 
you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars 
early on), eliminating one after every third race 
(assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a 
race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a 
row without using a continue you get a time-trial 
race which can earn you an extra life. 
 
The real innovation of the game was in the 
multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, 
and when one car gets far enough ahead to force 
the other car off-screen, the slider moves in 
their favour. Once it reached the end (which 
involved beating them 4 times more than they beat 
you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were 
completed, the person leading at that point is 
declared the winner - with a sudden death play off 
if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available 
in this mode, although you can also play this Head 
to Head system as a 1-player game across all the 
tracks.

Misadventures of Flink, The (c) May, 1994 
Psygnosis Limited / Psygnosis Limited 
 
The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in 
the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard 
Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and 
it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set 
them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright. 
 
Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game 
has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create 
spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can 
combine three ingredients to create a spell. 
Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. 
They are usually carried around by a certain type 
of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are 
ten different spells, the "recipes" which are 
contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by 
rescued elders or found within certain levels. The 
spells include different attack spells (for 
example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks 
his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a 
quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so 
that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic 
keys that open locked treasure chests and more. 
Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be 
replenished by collecting magic bottles or 
defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, 
when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic 
energy and has only limited time to pick it up 
again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, 
he loses a life.

This is a sequel to Wonder Boy 5: Monster World 3. 
You control Asha, the green-haired girlfriend of 
Shion, the hero of the previous game. One day, 
Asha was standing on a cliff near her home 
village, and suddenly heard a mysterious voice 
calling for help. She decided to leave the village 
and to embark on an adventure to discover the 
identity of this mysterious person. 
 
Monster World 4 is essentially a platform game, 
with slight RPG/adventure elements (puzzles, 
treasure, equipment, etc.) Asha can jump, run, 
attack or defend (by pressing the "down" button). 
She can also use items and equip weapons and 
armor, talk to people, and open treasure chests. 
Later in the game, she will also be able to use 
magic, and a little blue pet animal will assist 
and help her on her journey. The combat system is 
very similar to the classical Zelda style. Health 
and mana points are measured in little hearts, and 
the more you progress in the game, the more hit 
points you gain. 
 
The game was released only in Japan. It is 
sometimes erroneously called "Wonder Boy 6".

Mortal Kombat (c) Sep, 1993 Midway Games, Inc. / 
Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well 
respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 
50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly 
sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was 
accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the 
Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). 
Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won 
by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be 
conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang 
entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat 
the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning 
supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for 
five hundred years now. As the last tournament 
required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and 
protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip 
the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters 
step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious 
island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces 
operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, 
fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding 
Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary 
Scorpion, and Raiden himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting 
game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, 
allowing each player to perform a variety of 
punches, kicks, and special moves in order to 
defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces 
their second round loss, the winner can perform a 
finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  
The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that 
graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked 
finale. 
 
Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade 
title. It is notable for its use of digitized 
actors to represent the game's fighters, as well 
as its use of copious amounts of blood during 
gameplay.

Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In 
order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao 
Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal 
Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests 
revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, 
the dimensional bridge between the two realms 
connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to 
invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the 
population's souls. 
 
A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" 
survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu 
Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents 
Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the 
riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former 
Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from 
his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary 
Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, 
Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, 
and Queen Sindel herself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D 
fighting series: multi-level playfields, 
"Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up 
the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new 
powers and abilities once both players enter a 
code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also 
included are more stage fatalities and finishing 
moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one 
with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn 
himself. 
 
Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one 
fighting game game in the series to feature 
motion-captured digitized graphics for its 
kombatants, and introduces online network play to 
the PC version.

Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his 
girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on 
the "eat the dots/avoid the ghosts" gameplay of 
the original game, but added new features to keep 
the title fresh. 
 
Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear 
four various and challenging mazes filled with 
dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while 
avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with 
their own personalities and tactics.  One touch 
from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for 
Ms. Pac-Man. 
 
Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her 
    pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers 
    located within the maze. During this time, the 
    ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them 
    for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 
    and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power 
    only lasts for a limited amount of time, as 
    the ghost's eyes float back to their center 
    box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man 
    again. 
 
Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player 
will be treated to humorous intermissions showing 
the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man 
and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the 
arrival of "Junior".

Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing (c) 1992 Park 
Place Productions / Virgin Games, Inc. 
 
Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name 
implies, is a boxing game featuring the three-time 
World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D 
sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called 
"FreeCam" 3D system), with the boxers moving 
around the ring in 360°. 
 
One or two players can choose the number of rounds 
(up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), 
the number of times a fighter must be taken down 
to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up 
to 10). There are two game modes: exhibition 
(which can be played against the computer or 
one-on-one by two players) and the tournament mode 
(single player). Players can choose among nine 
fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself. 
 
There are two control types: arcade and 
simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves 
the boxer around, while the A button is used for 
jabs, the B button for defense and the C button 
for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides 
which of the boxer's arms will be used for each 
punch. In the simulation mode, the d-pad moves the 
player around. By holding the A button (for the 
left arm) or C button (for the right arm), the 
player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in 
the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body 
hooks (by pressing left) and body hooks (by 
pressing right). Holding the B button, the player 
can cover up (by pressing up), duck (by pressing 
down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right 
(by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, 
the boxer performs an uppercut. 
 
Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they 
get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars 
decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker 
the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. 
By defending himself a boxer can regain power or 
speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at 
each side of the screen. If the fight ends with no 
winner, the judges decision is made by those 
numbers alone, regardless of how many times the 
fighters were taken down during the fight. 
 
The game features digitized speech, including 
samples of Ali's voice.

players consisting of zombies, skeletons, trolls, 
and robots.  The arenas are equally strange, with 
hidden bottomless pits, mines placed under the 
ice, spikes, and a "Demon Net" that functions as a 
goalie by chomping up and down and devouring the 
puck. 
The game plays similar to normal hockey, except in 
this game your players can pick up chainsaws, 
maces, axes, etc. to use against the competition.  
It's a bloody game, with opponents exploding into 
piles of goo (or circuits if they are a robot) 
when they become too injured.  The player can call 
special plays, like an exploding puck or jail 
break and attack the goalie.  The game also has 
fighting sequences if two players decide to get 
into a brawl. 
The game comes with multiplayer and a playoff 
series, full stats for your players and instant 
replays.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition (c) 1994 Midway Games,

This game lets you play two-on-two arcade 
basketball with players from all the NBA teams. 
Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few 
rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic 
jamming. Players are rated on eight ability 
categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 
3-pointers. 
 
Up to four human players can take part, each 
always controlling a single player for their team, 
and AI for missing players. This allows for four 
players to face each other in teams of two, or for 
two players to team up against a third player with 
a CPU team-mate. 
 
The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to 
three players, and allows for substitutions 
between quarters. Shoving players now results in 
injuries, which lower a player's stats

Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a 
racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of 
the same name and their top driver at the time, 
Englishman Nigel Mansell. 
 
The player has the option to drive a single race 
(where the option to practice is hidden) or go for 
the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks 
(with some variety, not only ovals) across North 
America, with the season opener in Queensland, 
Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend 
in split screen or with split screen against the 
computer, and if music or engine sounds are played 
in the race. 
A key choice in the game is selecting between 
Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car 
can take a lot less damage before giving up, 
fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules 
are enforced, under the risk of a 
disqualification. 
 
Graphically, the game is less sterile than most 
driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit 
consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of 
several polygonal buildings scattered around the 
circuits.

New Zealand Story, The (c) Mar 03, 1990 Taito 
Corporation / Taito Corporation 
 
One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games 
outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the 
evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them 
at the black market. Fortunately, during the 
kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, 
managed to escape the sack, and her job is to 
rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered 
around New Zealand, and are held in cages in 
various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, 
Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 
 
If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount 
of time, the devil will appear and try to kill 
her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, 
except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to 
meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice 
of weapons. Also making the rescue mission 
difficult are several nasties that attempt to 
throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at 
her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them 
using her crossbow and arrows. More often than 
not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave 
behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for 
points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get 
other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. 
Collecting all these letters will result in an 
extra life, and as for the weapons, they include 
laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 
 
In some levels, a few areas are located further up 
than just left or right, and the only way that 
Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the 
enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other 
areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes 
underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she 
has to rise up to the surface again to restore her 
oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is 
able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the 
top of the water.

NHL 94 (c) 1993 High Score Productions /

After establishing themselves in the virtual 
rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in 
NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real 
teams (including both expansion teams) and players 
of the new NHL season for the first time in the 
series. 
 
Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this 
edition sees for the first time the inclusion of 
the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep 
forwards (literally) in check, defenders also 
feature harder body checks, with new animations. 
For an additional challenge, players can also 
choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A 
popular feature in previous editions, fighting is 
completely removed from the game. Game modes 
include exhibition games (or "regular season" 
in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) 
and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options 
remain basically the same couple since the 
establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 
or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the 
new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on 
but no offsides). 
 
While there are some minor differences between 
platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for 
users and the MegaCD version has more stat 
screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual 
highlight clips here and there), only the PC 
version released at the same time features 
complete season action.

1997 edition of EA's NHL sport simulation series. 
Improvements in this edition come mostly in the 
graphical arena, with a refined version of the 
"virtual stadium" system that adds new camera 
angles (including the classical top-down one 
strangely missing from NHL 96), and polygonal 
players instead of the bitmap-based ones with 
motion-captured animations. 
 
Other extras include multiplayer support for up to 
8 players through network or Gravis's GrIP system, 
the option to create new players and trade them 
around, and the usual amount of EA sports licensed 
multimedia flair, including an interesting "Goalie 
Mask Viewer" which lets you observe the 
elaboratedly decorated helmets of 30 goalies.

NHL 98 (c) 1997 Electronic Arts, Inc. / THQ Inc. 
 
NHL 98 features much faster and refined gameplay 
(now using four action keys instead of two, 
removing the need to double-tap to perform some 
actions), along other new features such as 
"in-the-fly" tactics developed by Marc Crawford, 
then manager of the Colorado Avalanche and new 
commentary lines from Jim Hughson and Darryl 
Reaugh and a re-worked interface. 
Graphics are improved from the previous version 
with the players being less angular, and thanks to 
3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the 
textures. The in-game presentation follows a 
TV-style script, zooming in players while 
displaying stats during clock stoppages. 
 
As far as game modes go, in the year of the first 
Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 
98 introduced the first real international 
competition, with 18 International teams to choose 
from. Other game modes include Season (option to 
pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 
1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.

Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed 
Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a 
championship had finally come good. The game was 
pitched somewhere in between a full-blown 
simulation like F1 GP and action games like 
Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each 
race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. 
 
Before each race you can customize wing downforce, 
gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – 
pitstops are a standard feature of the longer 
races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 
'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized 
version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner 
of the screen, offering instructions and praise.

Nobunaga's Ambition (c) 1993 KOEI Co., Ltd. / KOEI 
Corporation 
 
In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring 
States") period divided the nation into numerous 
feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These 
daimyos would often go to war with each other. 
Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the 
Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those 
daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a 
merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players 
take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many 
other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 
 
Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game 
which can be played in different modes. Gameplay 
is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the 
Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting 
either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 
scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, 
each of which is rated attributes in several 
categories

Based on the 1994 movie of the same name starring 
Ray Liotta, the player takes control of Liotta's 
character, Capt. J.T. Robbins, whose only 
objective of the game is to escape an island. 
After shooting his commanding officer, Robbins is 
imprisoned and eventually sent to the island 
Absolom as a war criminal, from where there is no 
escape possible. To do this still, the player must 
explore the island with side-scrolling platform 
gameplay for clues, finding items and combining 
them to make weapons and traps. 
 
Robbins can talk to some prisoners to help him in 
his quest, but he must also avoid violent 
prisoners, either by attacking them with punches 
or kicks or using traps and stealth to bypass 
them. The graphics are based off of rotoscopes of 
the actual actors from the movie.

Olympic Gold - Barcelona 92 (c) 1992 Tiertex Ltd. 
/ U.S. Gold, Inc. 
 
The official game of the Games of the XXV 
Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring 
seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, 
Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard 
diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming. 
 
Gameplay features the typical button mashing 
formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 
110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a 
button mashing sequence with just some changes: in 
the hurdles the player must hit the action key to 
jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of 
speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over 
one and an half minutes and the action button 
touches the edge for the return swim. In these 
events, the player initially faces a semi-final 
round and only qualifies for the final if ends in 
the top half. It's possible to watch the other 
semi-final. 
Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, 
along an accurate press of the action button to 
release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an 
initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to 
set the bar, then pressing up and the action 
button to release the pole and jump over the bar. 
Archery is a technical event where the player has 
three rounds with six arrows each, the winner 
being the one with the highest score on all three 
rounds. 
 
The player can choose to compete for eight 
nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, 
hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS 
(formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's 
own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to 
compete against the player. Each athlete is 
unique, and will perform differently according the 
the event: in some they are capable of braking 
World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a 
final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in 
two tables: sorted by medals and by total score 
(the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 
13).

Olympic Summer Games Atlanta 96 (c) Jun, 1996 
Tiertex Ltd. / U.S. Gold Ltd. 
 
Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official 
videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in 
Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title 
to be released on the console. A typical button 
masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m 
hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, 
javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 
32 countries around the world compete in custom or 
full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can 
compete head to head in the sprinting events, and 
a total of eight can play in the same game. Three 
difficulty levels allow competitive events for 
both rookies to veterans in the genre. 
 
Sprinting events are a short and straight button 
mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, 
the first winner advancing to the next round (two 
qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast 
fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world 
record times. 
 
Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing 
bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From 
the straight forward high and long jump events 
(run and then set the jump angle) to the more 
elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three 
jumps must be carefully measured for world class 
results) and the complex pole vault, where a 
strong run must be followed by a sharp pole 
fixation and good a release upwards. Both long 
jump and triple jump have a first round composed 
by three jumps, the better eight progress into the 
second round, where they are given three more 
jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the 
competition continues until all athletes miss 
three consecutive jumps. 
 
The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in 
the same fashion as the jumping events, although 
trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must 
be followed by a timely release. Each player is 
entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed 
three more attempts. 
 
Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a 
three-round competition where the goal is to amass 
as many points as possible by shooting at the 
inner rings of the target. With six arrows per 
round, each shot must be calculated according to 
the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower 
tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating 
the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can 
be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is 
a five round competition where the goal is to hit 
five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen 
with two slugs for each.

Ottifants, The (c) 1993 Graftgold Ltd. / SEGA 
Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary 
evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at 
office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid 
imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has 
been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell 
from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze 
a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to 
fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, 
Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy 
caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - 
workaday objects and boringly normal settings as 
seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad! 
 
The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D 
side-scrolling platformer where the player 
controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with 
the house and the basement, through to the 
building site, the office and finally the jungle, 
whereas each world is in turn divided into three 
stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which 
gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing 
sweets at them, or suck in objects like 
out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down 
the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and 
red lollies are spread throughout the stages. 
Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's 
special skills and can - depending on the colour 
combination - transform the baby Ottifant into 
Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed 
with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and 
more. 
 
Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and 
collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's 
score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are 
several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the 
five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the 
rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 
1,000 point reward by completing them. On the 
whole there are two different tunes backing your 
journey through the game: one for the stages and 
one for the boss enemies. The varied background 
music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are 
completely missing, as is one entire world: The 
Garden.

Outlander (c) 1992 Mindscape International Ltd. / 
Mindscape, Inc. 
 
Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it 
licensed as an official Mad Max game, however 
Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the 
game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 
2). Your objective is to drive your car through 
the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang 
members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas. 
 
The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and 
side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to 
destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, 
gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car 
has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if 
some guy drives along side of you, a little window 
pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your 
shotgun. 
 
Along the road there are several towns, and every 
time you pass through one of them, an alarm will 
warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on 
these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and 
ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a 
side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your 
car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand 
combats. In the cities you'll also find new 
equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, 
nitro, etc.

OutRun (c) 1991 AM R&D Dept. #2 / SEGA of America, 
Inc. 
 
Race across varied terrain in this conversion of 
one of the most famous arcade racing games. Your 
Ferrari is at the ready, complete with female 
passenger, over a series of short tracks. 
 
Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the 
car, so you can see it. The roads are full of 
sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can 
cause the car to roll and lose you time. On each 
section of track there is a fork in the road, 
allowing you to choose which direction you go in. 
You have to complete 5 track sections in total, 
out of the 15 in the game.

OutRunners (c) 1994 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / Data 
East USA, Inc. 
 
OutRunners is a sequel to the classic arcade racer 
OutRun. It puts you behind the wheel of 8 
different race cars with the aim being coming up 
first on a world-wide cross-country racing 
tournament. 
 
As mentioned you get to select from 8 differently 
tuned cars, each with different handling and speed 
specs. and then ride out in hopes of getting the 
trophy. At the end of each stage you get to select 
between different branching routes that determine 
what your next stage will be, and thus the 
different routes you take to the end game 
determine what ending you get (if you manage to 
beat the other players). 
 
OutRunners places a big emphasis on competitive 
gameplay as you are always racing against another 
car, be it an AI or human-controlled one in a 
perpetual split-screen multiplayer mode.

The basic Outrun game structure is reused in this, 
with the main difference being that a futuristic 
setting has been used. The circuits have some 
spectacular inclines, and the cars do nearly 
700km/h. There are four different track sequences 
on offer, and your aim is to complete each section 
of track within the time limit. As in the original 
OutRun game, near the end of each stage there are 
forks in the road, allowing you to choose 
different routes within the track sequences. There 
are other cars on the road to avoid as well.

Out of This World (c) 1992 Delphine Software 
International / Virgin Games, Inc. 
 
You play Lester, a young physics professor, who 
suddenly finds himself in a strange alien world 
after a lightning struck during his particle 
experiment. Now he must fight for his life, first 
with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But 
what gives him courage is that he is not alone. 
One of the aliens, who together with him escapes 
from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. 
Friendship can overcome all the obstacles. 
 
Out of This World is an action adventure game, 
where the adventuring element is concealed behind 
what looks like a typical platform shooter. The 
gameplay is based mainly on physical and 
environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen 
interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy 
requires a different strategy, and often there is 
only one way to solve the problem. Typically, 
enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun 
you find near the beginning of the game

Pachinko Canyon (c) Dec 18, 1992 Soft Vision 
International Co., Ltd. / Soft Vision 
International Co., Ltd. 
 
Yokohama Pachi-Pachi Chinatown is an island where 
all the people love pachinko. One day, a 
mysterious evil panda decides he must have it, and 
steals it for himself, turning it into his own 
personal pachinko island, a place where anyone who 
enters can never leave. Chen is a man who loves 
pachinko, and one day he heads of to the famous 
pachinko parlors of Yokohama...and never returns. 
Fortune tells that very soon, the person who will 
stop the evils of this pachinko parlor will 
appear, and Chen's daughter, Ren, sets out on her 
18th birthday for Yokohama, looking for her 
father. 
 
Pachinko Kuunyan is a pachinko RPG much like the 
Pachio-kun series. The player controls Ren as in a 
standard role-playing game, but rather than 
fighting battles, she can enter pachinko halls and 
play the machines. Each of the five cities has 
several pachinko halls, and Ren must empty out a 
certain number of machines before she can move on 
to the next city. If she runs out of balls, then 
the game is over.

Pac-Attack (c) 1993 Namco Limited / Namco 
   Hometek Inc. 
 
Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler 
Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to 
many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, 
such as Puyo Puyo. 
 
The objective of the game is to place ghosts and 
then, after three pieces (which can include one or 
two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many 
ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game 
area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random 
between left or right, but as he goes moving on 
the game area (after you place him, of course), if 
he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game 
area, he will change his direction. As with many 
block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks 
and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. 
However, by filling up a meter on the left of the 
game area, a fairy may appear that can clear 
approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it 
only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that 
were on top of them will drop. 
 
Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus 
mode against another human player. It's similar to 
the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty 
of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many 
ghosts on his area. 
 
The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 
100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts 
with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number 
reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other 
modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the 
press of a button. 
 
All of the handheld versions (including the one on 
Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

Pac-Mania (c) 1991 Namco Limited / Tengen Inc. 
 
Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. 
   You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat 
   all of the dots on the board in order to 
   proceed on to the next round. Numerous, 
   multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying 
   to stop you. If you eat one of the power 
   pellets in the maze, the ghosts will 
   temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man 
   can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when 
   they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D 
   and is larger than screen which will scroll to 
   follow the action. To help get out of tight 
   spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But 
   be careful, because some of the ghosts have 
   learned this trick as well and you could end up 
   in a mid air collision!

defensive moves like blocking the goal for a short 
period of time, as well as offensive moves like 
splitting the puck into five "phantom pucks" which 
can distract the opposing player. There is a 
single-player mode where a series of increasingly

The fairy kingdom has long been threatened by the 
dark witch Wool, the leader of the Dark 
Undulation. The queen Velvet sent the cute little 
fairy Silk to seek aid by the red-haired witch 
Cotton, the only one who could defeat Wool. Cotton 
agrees under one condition: she will receive some 
willows as a reward, since willows are her 
favorite food. Finally, after defeating Wool, 
Cotton realized that someone poisoned the promised 
willows, and swears revenge. Accompanied by Silk, 
she begins to chase the mysterious enemy. 
 
"Panorama Cotton" is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter 
reminiscent of  Space Harrier, set in an 
animé-style fantasy world. Various levels scroll 
"into the screen", vertically, horizontally, or 
diagonally. You can move Cotton over the screen, 
shooting at oncoming enemies and avoiding 
obstacles on her way. Cotton can upgrade her 
weapon to higher levels as you advance in the 
game, and can also cast magical spells by 
collecting special items.

Players take on the challenge of one of the most 
beautiful and notorious golf courses in the world: 
Pebble Beach. These eighteen-holes demand 
accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute 
strength. The famous beach-side course is littered 
with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and 
cliff-side greens. 
 
Game play takes a classic approach - players 
control a selected golfer from a third-person 
perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power 
and accuracy meter with which players must start 
and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style 
putting system, complete with a topographic grid, 
lets the player know of the slope and elevation of 
the three-dimensional putting surface. 
 
As there are no other courses to play, this game 
is a tribute and testament to the challenging 
course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.

The Europe-only sequel to Pete Sampras Tennis, 
Pete Sampras Tennis '96 includes new features, 
such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax 
scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with 
an Indoor court joins the previously available 
Grass, Clay and Hard courts. 
 
Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - 
now the ball reacts differently in each court and 
it's harder to control the direction of the ball, 
meaning the powerful forehands that could win a 
game in minutes of the first game are much harder 
to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted 
in both power, direction and timing, facing the 
risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with 
a speedometer showing how fast the best serves 
went. All these are controlled using the three 
buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A 
button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing 
shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining 
the B and A or C buttons it's possible to add 
top/back or full spin to the ball, with the  Y 
axis changing the power and the X axis the 
direction. 
 
The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was 
replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras 
himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best 
suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, 
accurate and fast around the court), Minori 
Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), 
Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style 
of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), 
Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and 
volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, 
rookie all-arounder).  There are three game modes 
to square things up - Challenge (single match, 
pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament ("Party 
mode" for up to eight players) and World Tour 
(single player mode, where the player squares 
against seven computer players, with the option to 
play singles or doubles. There's a Pro mode which 
extend the match to three sets and increase the 
difficulty setting by enhancing  computer player 
AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).

PGA European Tour (c) 1994 Polygames / Electronic

European Tour is best thought of as a remake of 
the original game, rather than a sequel as such. 
It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 
top European pros, rather than the US-leaned

detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering 
the intervening years of advances in programming 
skill. 
 
The control system is the standard three-click 
method used in most golf games, but you can now 
define intended draw/fade levels in advance of 
playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a 
measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating 
the effect. 
 
As well as the Stroke Play games of the original 
(where you count the total score across the whole 
round of 18 holes, and compare this to your 
opponent), there are also Match Play (where the 
aim is to win as many individual holes as 
possible) and Skins (the same, but with money)

PGA Tour 96 (c) 1995 Hitmen Productions|NuFX, Inc. 
/ Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released 
for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the 
most advanced one. Instead of offering  several 
generic courses, the three available (Spyglass 
Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, 
with height differences visible (as well as the 
limited 3D abilities of the console allow). 
 
The player can either chose to play as one of the 
10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go 
Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest 
drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game 
(Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and 
Shootout), as well as a replay. 
 
Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved 
triple click system - one to start the swing, 
other to set strength and a final one for 
accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball 
(to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch 
or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts 
at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty 
level affects mostly the leniency of the triple 
click hit areas - while at novice it is possible 
to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro 
levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no 
excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible 
to make the longest drives, as the amateur and 
novice levels take a few yards from the total 
capacity of the club.

PGA Tour Golf (c) 1991 Sterling Silver Software / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions 
commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click 
control method (the first to start the swing, the 
second setting power and over-swing, the third 
setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of 
different shots, and required a sense of timing. 
 
Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 
'links' course designed by the programmers. Some 
of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water 
hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies 
to get the best approach to the green. 
 
When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, 
each representing top US golfers - ten of these 
appear with tactical advice for each hole.

The sequel to PGA Tour, this game was released 
solely for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive along 
with an alternative version for the Game Gear, as 
was getting more common for EA sports titles at 
the time, helping to drive the sales of the 2nd 
choice console. 
 
This update sees the series add ten professional 
players to the roster (60 in total) and have the 
ability to play against them on seven courses and 
across five tournaments. There is also a new 
graphics engine in place and new sounds to boot. 
Statistics became more detailed and the ball 
physics were improved through a Draw and Fade 
meter. Game data can be backed up through the 
built-in battery. Other features include different 
ball lies, dynamic wind conditions, digitized 
sounds, an improved automatic caddy and special 
shots such as chips, punches and fringe putts.

The team at Polygames make some small improvements 
to the latest PGA title. It has a US setting in 
terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA 
European Tour, with 8 courses in total. Control is 
via the standard method of setting the shot up, 
then pressing the button once to start a swing, a 
second time to set the pace, and a third time to 
set draw/fade. Before taking a shot the club 
choice, direction and intended draw/fade  (spin on 
the ball) are selected. You can play a 72-hole 
tournament against 60 other PGA pros, or practice 
the holes at your leisure.

The people on a technically advanced planet Mota 
make experiments to create biomechanical 
creatures. But one day, a creature was created 
that appeared to be dangerous to the humans 
themselves. No signal came to the capital city 
from the experimental labs... You, a nameless 
young man living in Paleo, Mota's capital, are 
commanded to go to the labs and check the issue. 
Your friend Nei, a semi-human girl, goes with you, 
and other brave adventurers join you on what 
starts with a simple mission but develops into 
saving the entire world... 
 
This is the first Phantasy Star game for the 
Genesis, set in a futuristic world. The turn-based 
combat allows you to choose between "fight", where 
the characters simply attack physically for one 
turn, and "strategy", where you can choose from 
several sub-commands, to defend, to use a special 
technique, or to run from the battle. Instead of 
magic there are "techniques", that require the 
usage of TP (technique points).

A long time ago, a great war between Orakio and 
Laya devastated the planet. 1000 years later, a 
young Orakian prince named Rhys decides to marry 
the beautiful Maya, his heart's chosen one. But 
during the marriage ceremony, a strange creature 
appears and kidnaps the bride. Were those the 
legendary Layans who kidnapped the princess? 
Whatever the answer might be, Rhys has to find it 
out on his own. He must find his beloved one... 
 
This game takes us back to a medieval setting. The 
battle system is similar to that of its 
predecessor  Phantasy Star II: you can perform 
simple attacks and special techniques, which 
require TP (technique points), in a turn-based 
combat with random enemy encounters.

system (viewed from first-person perspective). An 
unusual feature of this game is that some 
locations are also viewed from first-person

 To get win, you must change the landscape, 
creating flat land for your followers to build on.

powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build 
as fast as you can, because the other god is doing 
the same. 
 
When you have enough followers, you can make the

go around the land you have built, literally 
taking strength from the people into himself, and 
working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets

out for blood. He also has to contend with the 
Predator, both as a boss at the end of each level, 
and as a time limit - if the player takes too long 
to rescue a hostage, the Predator will blast the 
hostage with his tri-laser. 
 
The game is played in a third-person isometric 
view, with great swarms of easily-killed bad guys, 
who appear through one-way doors scattered 
throughout the level. Weapons not only include 
faster machine guns and shotguns, but also a few 
highly-advanced Predator weapons the player can 
pick up and use. Each defeated gang member drops 
drugs that can be picked up and automatically sent 
off to the "drug squad" for points. No sounds or 
music from the film get used, but stills scenes 
from the film do introduce the levels.

Premier Manager (c) 1995 Realms of Fantasy / 
Gremlin Interactive Ltd. 
 
The first game in Gremlin's series of football 
management games. You start off managing a team in 
the Conference (the fifth tier of English 
football) and aim to progress up the leagues, 
either by improving your existing team or earning 
jobs at better clubs elsewhere. 
 
The features at your disposal include selecting 
training regimes, planning tactics for each match 
based on your opposition's strengths and 
weaknesses, scouting for new players including 
youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and 
stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans). 
 
The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, 
as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated 
in each of the main skill areas) up against other 
teams who want them, and sell off players you 
don't need. You have an overdraft available, but 
make sure not to exceed it. 
 
The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches 
all take place at the same time. You can make 
tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.

Premier Manager 97 (c) 1996 Gremlin Interactive 
Ltd.|Realms of Fantasy / Gremlin Interactive Ltd. 
 
Premier Manager 97 is the second Mega Drive game 
in the hit football managing game series of the 
early nineties. Similar to the first run of games 
in the series (released between 1992 and 1994), 
the manager starts (in the Full Game mode) as a 
lowly division 3 (not Conference) manager, where 
the goal is to get the club to the top divisions, 
or get signed to better placed teams. In the Demo 
mode, the player can choose any Premier League 
team, but only for a season. 
 
In either of the modes, the player is responsible 
for carefully assembling the team (and unlike 
other managers, selecting the appropriate tactics 
is crucial to win the game), get the best from the 
transfer market by selling the fading stars and 
outselling the biggest clubs in England in the 
quest for the stars of the future, improve stadium 
capacity and quality (including seating, roof, 
security and others), sign good deals for ground 
advertising and balance the budget to make the 
team finish the season out of the red. 
 
Matches are always simulated, with a ruler showing 
where the ball is, and with text messages showing 
actions (like "player passes", player tackles" and 
so on). The chances of goals are shown in 
LED-style animated clips.

dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams 
in an hour. You're not going to let that happen 
are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out 
Jaffar's guards, find your way through the 
Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, 
you've got 60 minutes! 
 
Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and 
jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, 
solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword 
fights with the guards. The player has an infinite 
amount of lives, but has to restart at the 
beginning of a level each time he dies, and must 
complete the game within an hour. An especially 
noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent 
animation of your character. 
 
The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game 
feature additional levels and new enemies. The 
Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set 
of graphics but the level layout remains almost 
identical to that of the original.

Pro Quarterback is a football game featuring 27

NFL or NFLPA license, there aren't any real NFL 
teams or players here, although the teams included 
in the game represent the cities of their real 
life NFL counterparts and also mimic the colors of 
their team's uniforms. 
 
The games options allow the player to choose to 
play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, 
dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to 
choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 
minute quarters). There are also no penalties in 
this game whatsoever. 
 
Gameplay consists of playing on both offense and 
defense. There are 26 different offensive plays 
and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. 
The game has a down the field view when on 
offense, so the game doesn't have receivers in 
windows.

Pyramid Magic is a platform puzzle game that casts 
the player as a young explorer seeking a treasure 
hidden deep within a pyramid. Each stage contains 
blocks, treasure boxes, and an exit which is 
blocked by a ghost. The explorer can kick and 
destroy the blocks as well as carry them, and can 
also move through small openings by carrying 
blocks into them. However, if he falls even one 
square downward, the block will crush him and the 
stage must be restarted. He must collect the 
contents of each box in order -- the last contains 
an item which will dispel the ghost -- and reach 
the exit without either trapping or crushing 
himself with the blocks. 
 
After clearing each stage, a time bonus is 
awarded, and an extra life is earned for every 
3000 points. Every five stages, the player 
receives a password with which to resume play, and 
is also allowed to skip two stages. There are a 
total of 35 puzzles to solve.

Pyramid Magic III is the final title in the 
Pyramid Magic series of puzzle adventure games, 
and picks up right where the second game left off. 
Our hero is still inside of the same pyramid, but 
is finally nearing the treasure he seeks! 
Unfortunately, it would appear that the final step 
requires a large, heavy, fragile jug filled with 
some kind of liquid. He must now find a way to 
take this jug to where his treasure awaits. 
 
While the basic concept remains the same, the game 
is made more difficult by the addition of the jug. 
The jug is fragile: if it is kicked or dropped any 
distance, it will break and the stage must be 
restarted. However, it is also dangerous: much 
like the stone blocks, if the explorer falls even 
one square while carrying it, he will be crushed 
by its weight. In each puzzle, the player must 
collect all of the keys to open the door, but he 
must also reach the door while carrying the jug 
with him in order to proceed. There are a total of 
30 puzzles to solve, and once again the player is 
allowed to "pass" twice.

the evil monsters who have overrun them, by using 
the magical power of rainbows! In addition to both 
the Original and Extra modes, the game also

Rambo III (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of 
America, Inc. 
 
Based on the film of the same name, this game puts 
you in John Rambo's shoes as he travels to 
Afghanistan to free Colonel Trautman from the 
Soviets. 
 
In six missions, Rambo must complete various 
objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, 
prisoners must be freed and enemy ammunition 
supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an 
overhead perspective and has several weapons at 
his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never 
runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close 
range kills, set off timed bombs and use his 
famous crossbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition 
for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be 
collected from dead enemies. 
 
After some of the missions, the perspective 
switches to a view behind Rambo and additional 
boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or 
helicopters must be destroyed using the crossbow. 
While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but 
otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other 
obstacles from enemy fire.

Tetris meets shoot-'em-up, Rampart was originally 
a one or two-player arcade game combining strategy 
and artillery action. Build your castle from 
Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard 
the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. 
Later arcade revisions incorporated 3-player,  and 
the PC conversion does as well, making it a 
faithful, entertaining classic for multiple

Ranger-X (c) 1993 GAU Entertainment / SEGA of 
America, Inc. 
 
Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime 
of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer 
it was released with little fanfare and 
advertising but has become one of the best 
demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is 
capable of. 
 
The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You 
control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller 
side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two 
can join together providing an alternate shooting 
mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech 
however, the player can shoot both forward and 
back by using different buttons. The mech can also 
use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground 
and hover for a short while. Levels are not 
necessarily left to right moving (although for the 
most part they are) and the game is an interesting 
blend of platform game and shoot-em-up. 
 
The game features innovative graphics given the 
hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction 
to most levels (remembering that the console had 
no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and 
some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to 
give the impression of 3D backgrounds.

The "Rastania" was a sacred place, in which the

It is said that whoever conquer the "Skyscraper" 
would rule the "Rastania". A wicked group has 
invaded the "Skyscraper" and has tried to make it 
their own. If the situation is left as it is, the 
place would eventually be controlled by the wicked 
group. 
 
Rastan Saga 2 is the sequel to Rastan,   
containing the same hack-em'/slash-'em gameplay as 
the original. You are a warrior who must get 
through a number of levels, and trying to collect 
gems which can only be obtained by defeating the 
end-of-level bosses.  Collecting power-ups along 
the way awards you with extra life or better 
weapons.

$<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/genesis/red-zone_"</a>
$bio
 
 
Red Zone (c) Nov, 1994 Zyrinx / Time Warner 
Interactive, Inc. 
 
Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which 
you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy 
territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed 
dictator.  Under threat of global nuclear war the 
dictator has begun to annex his neighbor 
countries, with plans to continue his territorial 
expansion, so three special operatives are 
covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his 
ability to wage war. 
 
The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground 
attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty 
loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 
mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air 
missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from 
the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits 
and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep 
in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups 
are located so that the chopper is able to stay in 
the air and is able to keep fighting, elements 
that are very similar in implementation to the 
Strike series.  Differences between the games 
include the fact that as your systems get damaged, 
your helicopter becomes harder to control and the 
weapon and radar systems become affected. 
 
Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, 
there are numerous mission-oriented sequences in 
which the occupants of the helicopter disembark 
and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  
Each of the three characters have a unique set of 
weapons, and the player can choose from either of 
the three to use, so long as none of them have 
been killed during previous on-foot missions. 
 
Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the 
early entries of the Strike series of games, 
though while the first three games of that series 
had a fixed isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has 
a straight-down POV that rotates along with the 
helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent 
of Zyrinx's earlier and similarly technologically 
advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most 
notable similarities being in the relative 
difficulty of the games, and in the manipulation 
of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual 
effects not seen in other games, such as simulated 
video.

Players can alternate from controlling Ren to

even though they tend to use each other for their 
moves (i.e. Stimpy uses Ren as boomerang and Ren 
uses Stimpy as a bowling ball).

   customers by selecting the items they have 
   requested on a conveyor belt. 
 
2. Captain Salty: The player uses Huckle again 
   and uses a crane to piece together Salty's ship 
   by dropping them in the required spot which is 
   marked. 
 
3. Building House: This is essentially the same 
   as Captain Salty's stage, except this time 
   around the player is building a house instead 
   of a ship. 
 
4. Delivery Truck: The player uses Huckle and 
   Lowly Worm to deliver various objects to their 
   required shops while avoiding various obstacles 
   such as trashcans, crossing chickens and chairs 
   to name a few. 
 
5. Fire Station: This time the player takes 
   control of a pig fire fighter and transverse 
   BusyTown in a fire truck, collecting various 
   firefighter-related objects while avoiding 
   obstacles.  After each object is collected, the 
   player is then taken to a house fire where they 
   must put out the fire and rescue the trapped 
   animals inside. 
 
6. The Wind: The player can become the wind and 
   shown a top-down map of BusyTown and using a 
   whirlwind can interact with various objects on 
   the screen to view animations. 
 
Additionally, the player can choose these 
different locations at the main screen that has 
the player become Lowly the Worm and fly around 
the map using his Apple Helicopter.  It also 
features many the characters from Scarry's

Rings of Power (c) 1991 Naughty Dog, Inc. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
For a long time, our world was in darkness. The 
sun shone as always, but our souls were dark and 
lacked the true enlightenment. Then the holy Nexus 
arrived, and changed everything. With his Rod of 
Creation, he blessed the people with the gift of 
the six Arts. The Red Priests - the people he 
chose among the others - established an order of 
the six Guilds. The world entered the era of 
prosperity. But the evil demon Void stole the Rod 
of Creation and drove the world to chaos again. In 
a cosmic battle, Nexus faced Void. None was 
victorious, and the Rod of Power was broken during 
the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, 
known as the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer 
Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve those 
rings, and to unite the Rod of Power that will 
eventually banish Void forever! 
 
"Rings of Power" is quite different from 
traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is 
more similar to Western-style games such as  
Ultima series. You can freely wander through the 
huge isometric world, and are not obliged to 
follow any storyline except the main quest for the 
eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many 
topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. 
There is a day/night cycle which affects the 
behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there 
are no weapons and armor in this game. The 
turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic 
spells. On your journey you will encounter 
characters from several guilds, each proficient in 
his own type of magic, and make them join your 
party.

armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of 
the road, landmines, and more. 
 
Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to 
help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane 
will fly in and drop additional power ups that can 
be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, 
cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a 
very limited amount of fuel, however more can be 
picked up along the way by crossing the halfway 
point of a level, or by collecting the red and 
green fuel spheres that appear in the road or 
after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels 
collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be

Road Rash (c) 1991 Electronic Arts, Inc. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game 
where the player assumes the role of a biker who 
takes part in a series of illegal races across the 
U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the 
objective is always to finish first on a linear 
course, overtaking the other bikers. This is 
achieved by driving very well or by playing it 
dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using 
clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other 
racers fight back in a similar fashion and there 
are also hazards. All the races take place on the 
regular road with normal traffic (in both 
directions) and the cops, as well as occasional 
oil slicks and stray cows. 
 
By winning races you can get promoted to a 
stronger division and earn cash with which you can 
buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off 
your bike or hit something you will have to run 
back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus 
your bike will suffer some damage. When the player 
crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get 
busted and then you have to forfeit the race. 
 
Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has 
arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a 
motorcycle simulation. While the game has a 
two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.

Road Rash II (c) 1992 Electronic Arts, Inc. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
A motorcycle racing game with an attitude. You 
race in varying environments for ever increasing 
sums of money. With that money you can buy faster 
and better bikes. There are many objects on the 
road to watch out for, from cars to rocks to 
signs, if you hit one you'll go flying and loose 
valuable time. If you crash too often your bike 
can get wrecked. You can also attack other racers. 
The default attack is a punch, but some racers 
have weapons, which you can steal and use 
against them. The police patrol the various 
courses, so if you're not careful you can get 
busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but 
also a fighting game.

RoboCop 3 is a side-scrolling platform shooter. 
You get missions (such as rescuing your colleagues 
who are being kept hostages), which are divided 
into several smaller levels. The levels usually 
consist of several platforms, and are heavily 
populated by enemies who shoot at you. You can 
gather special repair kits, which will be used to 
restore your health after you've completed a 
level. "RoboCop 3" is more of a shooter than its 
predecessors, having more and tougher enemies.

RoboCop versus The Terminator (c) 1993 Virgin 
Games, Inc. / Virgin Games, Inc. 
 
The Dark Horse comic book crossover of the two 
famous 80s cyborgs spawned various different game 
adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the 
Genesis is only loosely based on the comic. 
 
The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of 
policing the streets of Detroit is lured into a 
trap by Terminators sent from the future. By 
uploading himself into the computer network, he 
becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet 
grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic 
future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the 
human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet 
once and for all. 
 
The game is a platformer with heavy shooting 
elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies 
stand in RoboCop's way and must be destroyed via 8 
different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with 
only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be 
found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser 
guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all 
guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried 
at the same time and being killed means the 
currently equipped gun is lost. 
 
The game is evenly split between present and 
future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include 
mostly street punks and other criminal elements 
while the future is of course populated by deadly 
machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders 
and many automated guns. Each level ends with a 
boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks 
and RoboCop's famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain 
(aka RoboCop 2). 
 
Some levels feature optional goals besides getting 
to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying 
security cameras.

Imagineering Inc. / Absolute Entertainment, Inc. 
 
The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the 
video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series 
staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying 
squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode 
of the show.  The story begins at the dedication 
of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle 
museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and 
Natasha have disguised themselves as security 
guards for the museum and managed to steal some of 
the priceless artifacts. 
 
Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen 
artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  
Most of the action is of the side-scrolling 
platformer variety, but along the way, you will 
get to play lots of mini-games involving 
characters from the show. During the platforming 
sections you can switch instantly between the two 
protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle 
can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for 
short instances.

Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball (c) Sep, 1992 
Sculptured Software, Inc. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
Roger Clemens is known by some as the greatest 
pitcher in baseball history. In  Roger Clemens MPV 
Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings 
baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full 
regular season can be played including the World 
Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. 
While playing in Regular Season mode the player 
can see their chosen team’s progress by using the 
in game calendar showing all the games. 
 
Players select a fictional team from the following 
groups: 
 
1. National Division West: San Francisco 
   Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big 
   Cats, San Diego Suns, Houston Mustangs, and 
   Atlanta Condors. 
 
2. National Division East: Chicago Swords, 
   Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. 
   Louis Commandos, Pittsburgh Panthers, and 
   Philadelphia Generals. 
 
3. American Division West: Oakland Bashers, 
   Seattle Pioneers, Minnesota Hounds, California 
   Waves, Texas Cowboys, Chicago Red Birds, and 
   Kansas City Kings. 
 
4. American Division East: Toronto Bears, 
   Boston Hornets, New York Rebels, Detroit 
   Wheels, Milwaukee Marshals, Baltimore Eagles, 
   and Cleveland Tomahawks. 
 
Each team has a set of players the make up the 
team each with their own skill level and 
statistics which, like the teams, is fictional 
other then Clemens himself who is on the Boston 
Hornets team. 
 
When controlling the pitcher the player can 
control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as 
the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher 
can also stop the opponent stealing a base which 
can be seen via windows showing the positions of 
all the baserunners. When controlling the batter 
the player has to time the hit to successfully hit 
the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, 
or has the option to not hit in case of a ‘ball’.  
The player can also steal a base while batting. 
After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding 
mode where the camera shifts to a view that is 
lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder 
gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). 
The player then controls the closest fielder to 
get or catch the ball and then throw it to the 
selected base. There are many different cameras 
angles that the game selects depending on the 
location of the ball. The camera can be on the 
left, center, or right side of the field in ether 
infield or outfield position and all cameras can 
pan to follow the ball. 
 
The player can use a password to save their 
progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition 
match can be played in two player mode with the 
use of two controllers.

A terrorist group has taken out the world

Ross or a woman named Leila, you must stop them. 
You can also get cool weapons that pack more of a 
punch than your ordinary hand gun. 
 
Also RT2 is a password supported game, so in other 
words you get a password at the end of each round 
so if you loss all your lives, you can continue 
from the end of that round, very handy.

Rolling Thunder 3 (c) 1993 Now Production Co., 
Ltd. / Namco Hometek Inc. 
 
The events in the third game in the series are 
synchronous with RT2. At the end of the twentieth 
century, satellites around the globe are being 
shot down, disrupting communications. Secret 
agency Rolling Thunder discovers the organization 
behind the terror: Geldra. While agents Leila and 
Albatross are fighting the leader Gimdo (RT2), 
agent Jay is instructed to bring down Dread, the 
second-in-command. 
 
There are many improvements to the gameplay: Jay 
can shoot while jumping and shoot diagonally 
upwards with certain weapons. At the beginning of 
each mission, you can pick a special weapon such 
as a laser rifle, bazooka, flamethrower or 
grenades. You have to choose carefully as they 
cannot be reused in later missions. You can still 
hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind 
special doors. The mission timer from the previous 
game has been replaced by a sniper that targets 
you with a crosshair when you don't move fast 
enough. The brutal difficulty from the previous 
games has been toned down: there are more life 
marks at the start and you now resurrect where you 
died, rather than returning to the last 
checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only 
choose one character to play with. 
 
After completing a mission, a password is provided 
to continue playing. There are ten levels in 
total, with a few hidden areas.

be much more 'stable' where players no longer have 
to worry that much about time length in the game, 
as the game take a slower time rate to allow the 
players to build up their forces without much 
interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is 
closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.

Co., Ltd. / SKOB 
 
Romance of the Three Kingdoms V is the fifth game 
in the popular turn-based strategy game series, 
based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "San 
Guo" ("Three Kingdoms"). The novel, written by Luo 
Guanzhong, is perhaps the most popular classic 
book in China and all countries influenced by the 
Chinese culture (such as Japan). Its events occur 
in the third century AD, during the Later Han 
Dynasty. Several army leaders (the most important 
ones being Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian) are trying 
to unite China under their rule, and each one 
strives to defeat his opponents. 
 
Romance of the Three Kingdoms V offers many 
innovations. You won't only participate at wars, 
but also manage your country, and learn resource 
management of people and goods. A new "Reputation" 
parameter directly affects the people's opinion of 
you as the leader. Multiplayer allows 
participation of up to eight players (playing the 
eight main characters). 
 
The game was never translated into English. It was 
released in Japan for the PC (both DOS and 
Windows), and for PlayStation. A Chinese 
translation of the game (DOS version) is 
available.

Rugby World Cup 1995 (c) 1994 Electronic Arts UK 
Ltd.|I-Space Interactice / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Australian Rugby League is the "sequel" of some 
sorts of Rugby World Cup 95, but focusing on Rugby 
League rather than Union. In addition to the 
20-team league that names the game and the State 
of Origin, a competition between two selections of 
players from New South Wales and Queensland, an 
European League (composed by twelve teams) and 
international playoffs (eight) are also available. 
It is possible to play friendlies, or jump 
straight to the club competition playoffs. 
 
Gameplay is simple, and focus on quick passing and 
running rather than kicking to gain distance. The 
A button controls kicks the ball (tackles in 
defense), B passes (or changes players) and C 
rushes and breaks tackles. There are a few 
additional tricks, such as pressing A+B to perform 
a short, lobbed kick or A+C to clear the ball from 
the defense. Kicking from a dead ball situation 
uses a three-click method. The first sets the bar 
in motion, the second the strength, and the third 
the accuracy. The stronger the shot, the less 
accurate it will be, and the initial position of 
the kicker also affects the direction of the ball. 
Each button represents a different ball height, 
from A (which is the lowest) to C (highest). 
Weather also affects how the game is played, as 
high temperatures with hard grounds make longer 
games tougher on the players (slowing them down) 
and cold, wet weather makes passing the ball more 
difficult.

property is deducted from your budget and 
completion of objectives adds to it. The money 
must be used to resupply weapons and buy 
additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous

   entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel 
   and may fire forwards, move up & down and 
   change orientation between facing left and 
   facing right 
2. Stinger: A prototype "next generation" 
   attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to 
   orientate in any direction to fire your weapon 
   accurately. 
3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for 
   excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is 
   the only vessel that can dock with other 
   vessels and one of only two that can pick up 
   undersea objects for transport. It comes with a 
   water jet to clear debris and a retractable 
   drill 
4. Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may 
   move up and down and change it's orientation 
   between left and right. It's weapons are 
   torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind 
   it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea 
   objects for transport 
5. Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this 
   vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. 
   It's main purpose however is underwater welding 
   and repair of objects. It can also activate 
   switches 
6. Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest 
   mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most 
   agile of the vehicles, and may take off in 
   bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons 
   with which to defend himself and is very 
   vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny 
   spaces that none of the other vehicles can 
   reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.

Second Samurai, The (c) 1994 Vivid Image / 
Psygnosis Limited 
 
At the end of First Samurai, the Demon King was 
able to flee back in time to ancient Japan, so our 
hero follows him back in time, and has 10 levels 
awaiting him. Unlike the original, each world is 
split into sub-levels, with a boss at the end of 
each one, emphasising the arcade side of the 
gameplay, which still combines hacking and 
slashing with puzzle-solving. 
 
As in the first game, you start without weaponry 
but can pick up swords and daggers as you progress 
through the levels. There are lots of hidden 
sections as you progress, which open up more of 
the end sequence to you, as well as several 
subgames including a shoot 'em up mode.

With the original Sensible Soccer having sold

with the sides present in the 92-93 European 
tournaments included, and the player names updated 
to take transfers into account. 
 
The game was tidied up and changed in a number of 
areas. The most significant change is the addition 
of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow 
card offenses or one ‘professional foul’ (denying 
your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) 
results in that player being sent off). The 
goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 
1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.

Sesame Street Counting Cafe (c) 1994 Electronic 
Arts, Inc. / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Counting Cafe is an educational game based on the 
popular children's show Sesame Street. The player 
controls Grover, working as a waiter at a 
restaurant, where Mr. Johnson appears and orders 
various items. The player must take Grover into 
the kitchen, collect the items ordered, and return 
to Mr. Johnson's table, where he will reward the 
player with a star if the order is correct. If the 
player picks up the wrong items, they can be taken 
to Cookie Monster at the back of the restaurant, 
who will eat them and clear Grover's tray. 
 
There are five sections to each "day" -- 
Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. 
Once the player has completed Dessert, a monkey 
will run by and snatch the last star. Grover then 
must chase after the monkey to retrieve his last 
star, after which the game will move on to the 
next day. 
 
After the first day, Sesame Street denizens will 
start appearing in the kitchen playing around with 
food items. Sometimes their activities with a food 
item will end up landing on Grover's tray, which 
may result in Grover carrying an unwanted food 
item, forcing him to give the food to Cookie 
Monster and having to collect the correct food 
items all over again.

Shadowrun (c) 1994 BlueSky Software, Inc. / SEGA

Welcome to 2050, chummer. 
 
Shadowrun is an action RPG of epic proportions. 
You take on the role of Joshua, a Shadowrunner out 
to discover who murdered his brother. 
 
Along the way you get into street brawls, deadly 
gunfights, run the Matrix, slip into and out of 
the MegaCorps, explore the wild wilderness and 
deal with every low-life mage and high-tech cyber 
Street Samurai in Seattle. 
 
Shadowrun was based on the FASA RPG of the same 
name, and while real-time, modeled every rule from 
the paper system, from character stats to 
experience to combat to weapons and equipment. 
 
The game used an overhead view for physical 
combat, and a third person "POV" when on Matrix 
runs. It allowed two other characters to join your 
party either temporarily or "for life" however 
long that may be...

Humans on Earth have lost their righteous ways. 
After seeing that this has happened, the Gods have 
decided to abandon the Earthlings and no longer 
protect them. Ashura, the King of an alien race 
hailing from the Evil World, decides that this is 
the perfect time to strike the vulnerable 
unprotected Earth.  It just so happens that one of 
the good gods, Hyperion, takes pity on the humans 
and decides to bestow his power to four of the 
strongest Earth warriors so they can go and defeat 
Ashura and his minions. 
 
The player takes control of these four warriors 
who are Leo, a fencer, Marco, a monk, and Horatio 
and Tiffany, whom are both ninjas (one male, one 
female). Each character fires their own type of 
weapon and each character can charge up their 
weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the 
characters also have a special weapon that can 
clear all the enemies on the screen but with the 
caveat that it can only be used once per stage. 
Each character also has a jump and speed attribute 
which when powered up allows them to jump higher 
and walk faster. Players can switch between all of 
the characters during a stage. 
 
The game has 9 different stages. The player can 
play the first six 
(mountain,harbor,street,future,glen, and forest) 
in any order. Each round ends with a boss which 
must be defeated to clear that round.

Shadow Dancer - The Secret of Shinobi (c) 1991 
SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
A.D. 1997, New York City 
 
Having vanquished the evil crime empire, Neo Zeed, 
the ninja master Shinobi and his combat ninja 
skills were not heard from for some time. But a 
new threat arose, in a reptilian form that lived 
on vicious instinct alone. The colossal monster 
moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was 
relentless. The souls unfortunate enough to 
survive became hostages, and mass panic swept the 
streets. 
 
It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His 
weapons were stealth and quickness of attack, his 
only allies facing overwhelming forces. Relying on 
Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, 
assisted by his faithful dog. 
 
Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is similar to 
Shadow Dancer for home computers, and consists of 
five missions containing three stages each. 
However, there are a few differences between the 
two. For example, in this Sega Genesis/Mega Drive 
exclusive, the stages are different, and you 
rescue hostages rather than disarm bombs.  Each 
mission ends up with you fighting a boss, and when 
you defeat each (except the final one), you also 
participate in a bonus stage where you must shoot 
all ninja flying towards you. 
 
Some of the enemies are also quite different. Some 
of the lizards, which appear in later missions,  
leave a "lizard coin", which you can collect for 
bonus lives.

Shadow of the Beast (c) 1991 Psygnosis Limited / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and 
enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew 
up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn 
him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature 
serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did 
his job, until one day he noticed a man about to 
be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering 
ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife 
descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes 
the face. Of his father. 
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his 
childhood and tormented past at the hands of the 
Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over 
his captors took over him, he swore revenge and 
fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his 
father and redemption would be hard. 
 
Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular 
titles during the 16-bit computer era is a 
side-scrolling platformer best known for the use 
of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a 
musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover 
by Roger Dean and what many consider to be 
unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very 
challenging" and the "impossible". The player has 
to navigate through several areas filled with 
enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating 
triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the 
means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves 
the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump 
and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. 
While most enemies die with just one hit, the 
player must time each attack accurately. However, 
there are also traps of objects that cannot be 
destroyed, and these require the player to jump, 
duck or move according the sequence. The player 
has only one life with 12 hit points that can be 
replenished by collecting some objects hidden in 
the level (like an off-route location or a under a 
megalith), which also contributes to the 
difficulty level.

In a wondrous land perhaps not so far from our 
world, a strange and terrible series of events 
took place. The powers of darkness, led by Dark 
Dragon, fought for control of the world of Rune. 
Legendary warriors of light fought them with the 
ancient and modern weapons of the time, and drove 
Dark Dragon into another dimension. But Dark 
Dragon vowed that in 1,000 years, he would be able 
to break through the inter-dimensional barrier, 
back into this world. 
 
A thousand years of peace and tranquility passed. 
The people of the world were happy to live their 
lives in contentment, able to spend time 
rediscovering the magical and technological 
wonders destroyed by Dark Dragon and using them to 
benefit all people. 
 
But the kingdom of Runefaust has begun a massive 
attack of the kingdoms of Rune - intending to help 
Dark Dragon return to this world! A small band of 
warriors has been sent out on a dangerous journey 
to fight against the dark forces of Runefaust, and 
you are the leader. Prepare yourself for the 
ultimate battle! 
 
Shining Force is a strategy/RPG.  As you make your 
way through the lands of Rune, you will be joined 
by other warriors who wish to stop the forces of 
Runefaust.  Each warrior has their own strengths 
and weaknesses.  As you progress through the game 
you will also gain new weapons and spells.  Use 
them wisely to stop Dark Dragon from arising and 
causing havoc in Rune.

Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle 
game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban 
Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The 
player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, 
from a top-down view. As shown on the title 
screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make 
his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a 
fiery red sports car. 
 
The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds 
each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can 
be selected while playing but a new stage will 
only be opened up when all rounds have been 
successfully completed. To complete a round, 
Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the 
designated spots. This will turn them into a 
different colour. This is no easy task as the 
level design will obstruct many moves and cornered 
boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is 
possible to restart the round, undo the last step 
and the game keeps track of the number of steps 
taken. 
 
The game supports passwords and includes an edit 
mode where new levels can be designed and played.

Show do Milhao (c) 2001 Tec Toy S.A. / Tec Toy 
S.A. 
 
Show do Milhão is based on a Brazilian TV game 
show by the same name, hosted by Silvio Santos, a 
famous Brazilian TV presenter, owner of SBT, one 
of the greatest TV channels in Brazil. 
 
Show do Milhão (One Million Show, in English) is 
basically a quiz game, with 16 questions divided 
in three blocks of five questions each, plus the 
one million question. Each question has 4 
alternative answers, of which just one is right. 
The player wins a money prize for each right 
question. If he decides to stop at a certain 
question, he wins half of the questions' prize. If 
he guesses wrong, wins a quarter of the prize. But 
the rules are different for the last question: if 
he guesses wrong, he looses all the money he has 
won during the game. If he stops, takes half the 
prize as usual. 
 
The player can also skip questions up to three 
times. If he skips a question, other one with the 
same prize is displayed. He can also ask for help, 
which comes in three different manners: cards, 
players and guests. 
 
If the player chooses the cards help, he must pick 
one of three shuffled cards (K, A, 2 and 3), each 
one corresponding to the amount of wrong choices 
that will be removed from the screen (the K 
meaning no removal at all). 
 
If the player chooses the other (in this case, 
simulated) players help, a screen showing the 
percentage of players guessing each answer will 
appear (in the real game show, many players 
participated each night, taking their turns at the 
central place). 
 
If the player chooses the guests help, three

Show do Milhao Volume 2 (c) 2001 Tec Toy S.A. / 
Tec Toy S.A. 
 
Show do Milhão Volume 2 is a sequel to Show do 
Milhão, a game based on a Brazilian TV game show 
by the same name, hosted by Silvio Santos, a 
famous Brazilian TV presenter, owner of SBT, one 
of the greatest TV channels in Brazil. This sequel 
is exactly the same game as the previous one, 
except for the questions, all new. 
 
Show do Milhão Volume 2 (One Million Show, in 
English) is basically a quiz game, with 16 
questions divided in three blocks of five 
questions each, plus the one million question. 
Each question has 4 alternative answers, of which 
just one is right. The player has 40 seconds to 
answer, and wins a money prize for each right 
question. If he decides to stop at a certain 
question, he wins half of the questions' prize. If 
he guesses wrong, wins a quarter of the prize. But 
the rules are different for the last question: if 
he guesses wrong, he looses all the money he has 
won during the game. If he stops, takes half the 
prize as usual. 
 
The player can also skip questions up to three 
times. If he skips a question, other one with the 
same prize is displayed. He can also ask for help, 
which comes in three different manners: cards, 
players and guests. 
 
If the player chooses the cards help, he must pick 
one of three shuffled cards (K, A, 2 and 3), each 
one corresponding to the amount of wrong choices 
that will be removed from the screen (the K 
meaning no removal at all). 
 
If the player chooses the other (in this case, 
simulated) players help, a screen showing the 
percentage of players guessing each answer will 
appear (in the real game show, many players 
participated each night, taking their turns at the 
central place). 
 
If the player chooses the guests help, three 
guests will take their guesses on the answer, and 
you can go by their guesses or not (on the real 
game show, those guests were college students). 
 
The game features the digitized voice of Silvio 
Santos, as well as the show's main theme. All the 
text is in Portuguese.

Shura no Mon (c) Aug 07, 1992 SIMS Co., Ltd. / 
SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Tsukumo Mutsu, a young student of Karate, has come 
to the city seeking the Jinmukan dojo, looking for 
a challenge to prove himself. He's gotten lost, 
but a young girl helps him out. She happens to be 
the granddaughter of the head of the dojo, and 
doesn't want him to get involved with the place, 
but Tsukumo insists on continuing regardless. He 
walks right in, and takes on the first guy in a 
karate gi he comes across... 
 
Shura no Mon is a so-called "command action" game 
based on the manga by Masatoshi Kawahara. The 
player controls Tsukumo by selecting commands from 
a list, using different attacks and defensive 
maneuvers at the appropriate time, with the 
results shown via brief animated sequences. 
Between bouts, lightly-animated visual scenes 
progress the story. The plot closely follows the 
first arc from the manga, starting with Tsukumo's 
arrival at the legendary Jinmukan dojo.

The main objective is to cross different USA

every error can be lethal! 
 
The game also comes with modes for 2 players with 
two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional 
mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to 
sink 9 balls before the other player makes them 
first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick 
Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox. 
 
After each stage completed (and some luck), a 
bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to 
earn extra balls. You will only need a good target 
in the parquet block!

Simpsons, The - Bart vs The Space Mutants (c) 1992 
Imagineering Inc. / Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game 
where the player goes into the role of Bart 
Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must 
stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield. 
 
On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or 
get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants 
are planning to use to build their machine, such 
as purple objects or balloons. He also has to 
collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence 
(brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), 
so his family members will help him when he meets 
a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow 
Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants 
are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to 
discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must 
use his X-ray Specs. 
 
The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought 
by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, 
in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple 
objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash 
them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle 
solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him 
get out of the bar. 
 
Bart also has some coins that can be used in many 
ways throughout the game, like buying things, 
getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are 
essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

Smurfs 2, The (c) 1996 Virtual Studio / Infogrames 
Europe SA 
 
Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive 
Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs' 
laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows 
them to travel to anywhere in the world, but 
suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! 
Now they must face the challenges in all 
continents in order to retrieve all shards of the 
Crystal and return home. 
 
A classic platformer, this title allows the player 
to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette 
(there are no differences between characters) and 
collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  
There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels 
rather than killing enemies (no score is given for 
them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, 
but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in 
Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards 
can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using 
the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or 
vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, 
improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has 
four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is 
lost and the player must restart the level. Once 
all lives are lost, the game is over - there are 
no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts 
and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden 
somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's 
a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are 
collected at the end of the continent. In these 
bonus levels the player collects as much objects 
as possible which translate into hearts when the 
time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up 
is awarded.

It's a race to the moon for the two snakes, Rattle 
and Roll!  Play alone or simultaneously with a 
friend as you out-score and out-eat your opponent 
- then weigh yourself on the scales and make for 
the exit! 
 
Snake, Rattle 'n Roll is an isometric 3D 
platformer.  The object of each level is to eat as 
many Nibbley Pibblies (round creatures of various 
colours) as possible to make your snake heavy.  
Once it's heavy enough, you must stand on the 
scales in the level, and if you're heavy enough, 
the door will open and you can make your way to 
the exit. 
 
As with many platform games of its era, Snake, 
Rattle 'n Roll is incredibly difficult.  Foes 
include Jaws, a monster that's all teeth and will 
kill you if you stay in the water too long, and 
Bigfoots, which stomp all over the place and 
require multiple tongue lashings to defeat.  Then 
there's the many types of Nibblies, such as 
Pibblesplats, which hop around and splat into 
puddles, Pibbleboings, which are spring-loaded and 
jump incredibly high, and Pibblewings, which fly 
high out of reach. 
 
Two-player mode provides both a co-op and 
   competitive experience: while you are both 
   trying to eat more Nibblies than your opponent, 
   if you both stand on the level's scale at the 
   same time, both of your weights will be counted 
   and it will be possible for you to exit the 
   level more quickly.

Sonic 3D Blast (c) 1996 Traveller's Tales Ltd. / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that 
the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that 
can travel between parallel worlds, were captured 
and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of 
Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in his never-ending quest 
for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate 
Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik. 
 
Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the 
Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the 
blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare 
appearances in Personal Computers. The title, 
considering the era it was released, is somewhat 
misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics 
it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not 
only forwards and backwards, but also left and 
right. 
 
Gameplay is much slower when compared to other 
games in the series, and the number of badniks is 
reduced to five in each section. As usual, when 
Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free 
from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick 
him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. 
While they can be taken one by one, exploring the 
level with all five allow the player to reach for 
otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. 
Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a 
requirement: if the player completes a level in 
more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there 
would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to 
collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must 
find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 
rings.

Sonic and Knuckles (c) 1994 Sonic Team / SEGA of 
America, Inc. 
 
Sonic and Knuckles continues the story directly 
from where Sonic the Hedgehog 3 left off.  The 
explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying 
deep into Floating Island's Mushroom Hills.  Sonic 
knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on 
Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik 
wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power.  
Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can 
Sonic stop Robotnik's plans and find the Master 
Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles?  
Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island 
when he's attacked by one of Robotnik's robots!  
He quickly begins a chase for revenge. 
 
Sonic & Knuckles is the fourth game in the Sonic 
series.  It retains the same basic features as in 
the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for 
protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as 
well as the three different shield types 
introduced in Sonic 3 (Fire, Water and Electric).  
Players can select either of the two title 
characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new 
Knuckles the Echidna.  Knuckles cannot jump as 
high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the 
jump button while in the air.  If you glide into a 
wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it.  He 
can also break through walls that Sonic can't.  
With these abilities, Knuckles can access 
different areas from Sonic, making for each level 
an entirely new experience. 
 
Unlike Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles features three 
bonus stages - two are available by jumping into 
the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in Sonic the 
Hedgehog 2.  These stages give you the chance to 
earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  The first 
is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a 
slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings.  The 
second is a more skill-based level where you must 
time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and 
collect bonuses.  If you hit the barrier at the 
bottom of the stage, it ends.  The other type of 
bonus stage is the "Special Stage" seen in Sonic 
3, which, as previously, can be accessed by 
jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels 
themselves.  If the player collects all the blue

A unique feature of the Sonic & Knuckles cart is 
the ability to "Lock-On" previous Sonic games into 
a cartridge slot at the top.  Adding Sonic 3 will 
combine both Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles into one 
long game, as well as adding the ability to save, 
and use Tails in the Sonic & Knuckles levels.  
Plugging in Sonic 2 lets players use Knuckles in 
Sonic 2, as well allowing the use of his glide and 
wall climb abilities.  Finally, plugging in the 
original Sonic the Hedgehog cart lets the player 
access unlimited level variations of the Blue 
Sphere bonus stage.  Subsequent re-releases of 
Sonic & Knuckles have also included most of these 
bonus features.

Sonic the Hedgehog (c) Jun 23, 1991 Sonic Team / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games 
starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side 
scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. 
Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, 
allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with 
ease. 
 
The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. 
Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal 
friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  
Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by 
destroying the robots with his spin attack. 
Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the 
all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them 
before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. 
 
Sonic's weapon is his spin attack

Inc. 
 
The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. 
In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms 
all animals into robots called 'Badniks'. This way 
they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg. 
 Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong 
partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik 
and his army of Badniks from taking over the 
world. 
 
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling 
platformer based around speed, and the sequel to 
Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players 
run through different worlds called "Zones", which 
each have their own specific theme.  There are two 
Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end 
of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik 
controls, which you must defeat to progress. 
 
Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are 
scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with 
most platformers, when the player collects 100 
rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the 
rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt 
when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere 
and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again 
when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. 
 
If the player reaches a continue point lamppost 
with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access 
the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather 
a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage 
before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the 
checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos 
Emeralds. 
 
New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play 
the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a 
player can plug in a second controller and take 
over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite 
lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, 
meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic 
(and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing 
start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the 
jump button for a "Spin Dash".  This is useful 
when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where 
you need some momentum. 
 
The game also features a 2-player versus mode.  
This mode is a horizontally split-screen race 
through levels based on three of the zones in the 
single player game.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (c) 1994 Sonic Team / SEGA of 
America, Inc. 
 
Dr. Robotnik's Death Egg has crash-landed on 
    Floating Island, so called because it 
    harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to 
    float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to 
    repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian 
    of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that 
    Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With 
    Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes 
    at every turn, will they be able to stop 
    Robotnik in time? 
 
Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic 
series of games.  As with the previous games, it 
is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. 
 The basic game remains the same - players collect 
rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for 
protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is 
hurt.  Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, 
and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, 
then letting go of down. 
 
New to Sonic 3 are three different types of 
shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from 
fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water 
Shield (which lets you breathe underwater 
infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls 
nearby rings towards you).  Sonic can use extra 
abilities when he has these shields by pressing 
jump while in the air - either a horizontal 
fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an 
electric double jump.  If Sonic has no shield 
active, he can activate a brief energy shield, 
also by pressing jump in the air.  Tails cannot 
use the shields' special abilities, but he can 
instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a 
limited time.  He can also carry Sonic with him 
while doing so. 
 
There are now two types of bonus stages - one is 
available by collecting 50 or more rings, running 
past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into 
the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  
This stage give you the chance to earn bonus 
rings, lives and power-ups.  In this stage, there 
is a giant gumball machine.  By hitting the crank, 
you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be 
rings, lives or bonus shields.  The stage is over 
when you fall down the bottom of the screen. 
 
The other, more important, Special Stage can be 
accessed by jumping into giant rings that are 
hidden away in secret areas in each level.  In 
these stages, you must collect all the blue 
spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the 
stage early).  Collecting all of the outer blue 
spheres around square or rectangle sphere 
formations will turn them all into rings - if you 
collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a 
continue.  Once you collect all the blue spheres 
in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the 
seven Chaos Emeralds. 
 
Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are 
made up of two Acts.  At the end of each Act is a 
boss that must be defeated to complete the stage 
and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik 
has captured to turn into Badnik robots.  The 
zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times 
bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature 
multiple, branching paths. 
 
As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, 
which plays in a split-screen horizontal style.  
There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode 
which do things like swap player positions, lose 
rings, or cause a Badnik to appear.  You can also 
race against the clock in a time trial mode.

Sorcerer's Kingdom (c) 1992 Technical Wave / 
American Treco Corporation 
 
Sorcerer's Kingdom is a mix of RPG and strategy 
game. You play a young adventurer, who is sent out 
by the king to find out the reason for the 
increasing number of monsters that threaten the 
land and restore peace to the kingdom. Starting 
out as an Adventurer you are eventually given 
higher titles by the king, as a reward for 
completing quests. 
 
The game plays like a typical RPG but the battles 
are a little unusual. Whenever you are attacked or 
attack a monster that is within your current 
range, a turn-based battle starts immediately 
without taking you to a separate fighting area, 
and you have to fight all enemies that were 
visible the moment the battle started.

Sorcerian (c) Feb 24, 1990 Nihon Falcom Corp. / 
SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer 
series. It is set in the fantasy land known as 
Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of 
protection from ferocious creatures roaming the 
wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of 
adventurers, and their first assignment is to 
retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where 
it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks. 
 
The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling 
perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a 
cross between  Wizardry and platform games. 
Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles 
Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on 
character development than story. In the 
beginning, the player creates a party of four 
characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, 
and dwarf (races and classes are not 
distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, 
there are many things that can be done in the 
towns of the game, including complex development 
of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different 
disciplines), training to raise personal skills 
(strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons 
with elemental magic, as well as looking for 
part-time jobs. 
 
The view switches to side-scrolling when the party 
ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed 
in real time, with the player controlling the 
entire party at once. The lead character can be 
changed at any time, and battle actions will be 
carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks 
and magic spells are unleashed by pressing 
corresponding buttons. The characters can also 
jump and interact with objects by bumping into 
them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some 
contain simple puzzles such as finding and 
activating hidden switches to open doors.

Space Harrier II (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Space Harrier II follows (very closely) in the 
footsteps of its predecessor and involves you (a 
Space Harrier) going off to save "Fantasy Land". 
This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors 
the game throws at you leads me to believe that it 
was born out of a bad acid trip. 
 
There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around 
and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. 
The game is played from behind the main character 
and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the 
effect used in many car games such as Outrun. 
 
The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from 
the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new 
ones as well.

Sparkster (c) 1994 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami 
(America), Inc. 
 
Sparkster is the sequel to Rocket Knight 
Adventures and is completely different from the 
contemporary SNES title Sparkster. It takes place 
immediately after the events of the first game. 
The interactive introduction scene shows Sparkster 
picking up a new sword after the final fight when 
his nemesis Axel Gear appears, the rocket knight 
gone evil. After a fight in giant robots, 
Sparkster manages to save Princess Cherry and 
returns her to the queen. Then suddenly Axel 
appears again and he kidnaps her. It turns out 
Axel is working once more for the Empire of Gedol. 
Sparkster has to return the peace in Kingdom of 
Zebulos, save the princess and bring an end to the 
evil empire. 
 
The game consists of six levels with 2D 
side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The opossum 
Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with 
his sword. Using his rocket pack, he can also 
perform stronger attacks and burst through the air 
in different directions. The rocket power consists 
of a double meter that refills gradually, making 
it possible to perform successive attacks in the 
air, ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows 
for the strongest attacks, but fills more slowly. 
Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore 
health and different types of power-ups for his 
sword. Most levels have typical platform gameplay, 
but there is also a level where Sparkster walks 
around in a giant robot, knocking enemies out of 
the air. 
 
For an additional challenge players can locate the 
seven swords hidden throughout the levels. When 
all of them have been found, the hero turns into 
Golden Sparkster. The game includes a password 
system.

Speed Ball 2 - Brutal Deluxe (c) 1991 Bitmap 
Brothers, The / Arena Entertainment|Mirrorsoft 
Ltd. 
 
Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in 
fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever 
seen. As their manager, it is your job to 
transform their fortunes. As well as the league 
system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and 
challenges you to advance to the top, there are 
also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out 
over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding 
who progresses. 
 
You can play the matches as well, which is the 
real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second 
periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and 
frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to 
retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on 
the pitch, including ones to make your players 
extra-tough or freeze the opponents. 
 
The sides of the pitch each include a score 
multiplier, which you can run the ball through to 
increase the value of your scoring - the 
opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball 
and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are 
worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you 
have the multiplier activated), but these can also 
be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the 
same star, and their points values only become set 
after the half. Next to the stars there are 
'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite 
side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. 
 
You get money for the results, and by collecting 
the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at 
random intervals. Between each match you can spend 
these either on improving your existing players as 
far as they can go, or on buying better ones and 
fitting them into the team. Your original players 
can only be improved to a certain extent, so 
remembering where your signed players are and 
making use of them is important. 
 
A variety of tokens also appear during the match, 
some of which boost your team's power for a short 
period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

bomb has been planted somewhere in the city, and 
that it'll go off in 24 hours! What's worse, he

And he must also clear his name, so he takes his

Splatterhouse 2 (c) Aug 03, 1992 Now Production 
Co., Ltd. / Namco Hometek Inc. 
 
It has been three months since your escape from 
the Splatterhouse in the first game. Having been 
unable to save Jennifer, you keep having the 
recurring dream where she is begging you to come 
and rescue her. The mask from the Splatterhouse 
appears and promises that there is still a chance 
to save her. There is a downside to it, though. 
Wearing the mask of terror will fill you with 
feral rage and an insatiable hunger for blood. 
 
Heavily influenced by films such as Evil Dead 2, 
the game takes you through eight, side-scrolling 
stages. Rick has a basic set of punches, kicks and 
flying kicks, but he can pick up additional 
weapons such as a lead pipes, bones, bombs, a 
shotgun and a chainsaw for the ultimate bloodfest, 
while fighting skulls, razor fish and giant 
demons. A boss, requiring a specific pattern of 
moves, awaits you at the end of each stage.

It has been a while since the escape in 
Splatterhouse 2 and Rick is slowly regaining his 
sanity. At night, he is still haunted by 
nightmares from the place. Rick has married 
Jennifer and they have a son, David. In the final 
chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out 
that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped 
his beloved family members. He has no choice but 
to wear the demon mask with the supernatural 
powers to save Jennifer and David from the 
demon-infested Splatterhouse. 
 
The third title in the series builds upon the 
gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of 
six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a 
race against time, you have to wipe the demons 
from each room and find the quickest path to the 
boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an 
in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. 
Improvements over the second title include moving 
between rooms in multiple directions, multiple 
endings based on your performance, special moves 
for Rick and crisper graphics. 
 
It still has a horror theme and maintains the same 
level of gore and violence. You can collect 
weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an 
ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a 
ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it 
in another room of the house. Other collectible 
items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. 
These orbs build up a power meter. Upon 
completion, you have the ability to transform into 
a berserk mutant for a short time. The cutscenes 
feature real actors who act out the characters.

Starflight (c) 1991 Binary Systems / Electronic

A long time ago, a great empire comprised of 
Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. 
The Empire's currency was an energy source called 
Endurium. But something happened and this empire 
is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world 
named Arth has forgotten this heritage and 
technology. 1000 years have since passed and the 
people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological 
evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, 
they create spaceships and form the Interstel 
corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take 
the first steps back into space... but could it be 
the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still 
exists? 
 
Starflight is a space exploration game. The player 
must first form a crew, assign their positions and 
customize the spaceship before blasting off from 
spacedock. Once out into space, the standard 
interface allows access to different crew members 
and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and 
it's up to the player to travel to distant planets 
to explore and land on them. Using a top-down 
interface, a planetary lander will venture out 
with the task of  finding minerals and biological 
data to transport back to Starport. These 
resources can then be used to train crew members 
and improve the ship. Different alien races 
control the galaxy and it will be up to the player 
to engage them diplomatically or engage them in 
combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and 
alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as 
to the fate of the Empire.

Star Trek - The Next Generation (c) 1994 Spectrum 
Holobyte, Inc. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
The Romulans request permission to enter the 
Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of 
their researchers that they claim has gone 
missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor 
their activities and find out their real motives. 
 
Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding 
the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an 
away team on a planetary mission and combat with 
other ships. 
 
From the bridge you can control all of the ships 
main functions. Conn: Set course to a different 
planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: 
with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on 
your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. 
Computer: Access a database that contains lots of 
information on planets, races, technology, your 
crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got 
damaged during combat, you can use this command to 
allocate resources to the different parts of the 
ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: 
Receive orders and information on your current 
mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. 
Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it 
down to a planet (which is only possible if your 
current mission requires it). 
 
Before starting an away mission, you have to 
assemble a team of four crew members that differ 
in strength and in tactical and technical ability. 
Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. 
Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and 
Data can see in the dark and Data can survive 
without air. Away missions are shown from a 
top-down perspective and you can control each team 
member individually or order different members to 
follow your currently selected character around. 
Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real 
time) combat and puzzle solving that usually 
consists getting hints from tricorder readings and 
finding objects that have to be used in the 
correct way. 
 
Ship battles are also seen from a top-down 
perspective and let you attack enemy ships with 
phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye 
or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's 
torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you 
can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you. 
 
While the SNES and Genesis versions are 
essentially the same games, there are some 
noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays 
considerably faster during ship battles and on 
away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it 
takes much less time to repair the ship). There 
are many graphical differences and the map layout 
for away missions is slightly different from the 
SNES version as well.

Steel Empire, The (c) 1992 Hot-B Co., Ltd. / 
Flying Edge, Inc. 
 
The skies are populated by zeppelins, large 
battleships and flying fortresses. In this age of 
steel, the Motorhead Empire has conquered and 
enslaved almost the entire planet. The last free 
nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring 
the Motorhead Empire down using its newly 
developed weapon, the lightning bomb. 
 
Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel 
Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling 
shooter. At the beginning of every level, the 
player gets to choose between a striker plane and 
a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the 
zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore 
sustain more damage. Both ships use the same 
standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or 
backwards, as well as bombs that are released 
automatically while firing. Also available is a 
limited number of lightning bombs that damage or 
destroy all enemies on screen. 
 
Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including 
hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, 
bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience 
points. 
 
Options are small "drones" that fly alongside the 
player's ship and mimic its behaviour. 
 
Experience points can be collected to level up the 
ships' weapons (up to level 20) and thereby 
increase their fire power.

Streets of Rage (c) 1991 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, 
follows the story of three young police officers 
(Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a 
city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a 
"Mr. X" where crime is rampant, which leads the 
three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and 
topple the syndicate by themselves. 
 
Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three 
buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and 
another to perform a range attack from a support 
police car. Each character has a limited set of 
moves that include punching and kicking or 
performing a back attack (if in the open), two 
grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent 
in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if 
playing with another player two additional tag 
attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, 
but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and 
also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze 
fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter. 
Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller 
fashion: move from left to right (with two 
exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one 
after another as fast as possible while avoid 
taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels 
feature "death drops" where the player must avoid 
falling, while throwing enemies there at the same 
time, including a typical elevator level.  Several 
items are scattered on the ground, from melee 
weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional 
police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore 
health).

After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter 
destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the 
city became a peaceful place to live, and each one 
of them followed their own paths. One year later, 
after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned 
from school to find their apartment in a mess, and 
Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two 
friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam 
chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very 
well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful 
city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, 
Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, 
must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully 
for good... 
 
Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title 
in several ways. There are changes in both 
graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed 
and with more animation frames, and scenarios are 
less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was 
replaced by a special move that doubles in offense 
and defense along several new moves), along other 
new features such as life bars (and names) for all 
enemies and the radically different new 
characters.

In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X 
is back and this time his plan involves replacing 
public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, 
Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. 
Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up 
action you would expect from a Streets of Rage 
game. One new feature is the special move power 
bar, where it only costs energy to do a special 
move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the 
ability to do special maneuvers with different 
weapons, depending on the character. For example, 
Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does 
have one with the knife. The opposite is true for 
Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into 
energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. 
Secret characters and multiple endings add replay 
value.

glider into Meio's base. He is Hiryu, Super 
A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the 
Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once 
and for all. 
 
Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider 
lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb 
walls and overhangs. You wield a plasma sword, 
called a Cypher, through 5 levels fighting robots 
and guards, with mid- and end-level bosses.

Striker (c) 1995 Rage Software Ltd. / SEGA

The first game in the long-running soccer series, 
which stood out from the crowd with a unique 
forced perspective 3D view rather than a simple 
overhead one. The players are drawn large and 
there is a large scanner to assist with long 
passing. However, the standard mode has the ball 
sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy 
runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 
international teams on offer, with a 
European-style knock-out cup competition included. 
Many different formations and strategies are 
offered.

through impossible caverns rescuing miners and 
blast those aliens into the darkest pits of space! 
 
The game consists of 10 missions. Each mission 
takes place in a vast cavern, with interesting 
weather conditions. You must explore it and 
complete the mission objectives -- usually 
collecting sub parts, rescuing trapped miners, or 
destroying giant, epic bosses. You can also 
explore the levels, but keep an eye on your fuel 
gauge and beware the many hazards!

Summer Challenge (c) 1993 MindSpan / Accolade, 
Inc. 
 
The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer 
edition includes 8 events from athletics to 
cycling. The events are: 
 
1. Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, 
   and must navigate through gates without missing 
   or touching them (unlike the real event, there 
   are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to 
   hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward 
   paddles, pressing a direction along a button 
   allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one 
   with the fastest time after penalty time is 
   added 
2. Archery: Each competitor has four targets, 
   each with three arrows. By moving the 
   directional buttons the player moves the 
   erratic crosshair, while pressing a button 
   fires the arrow. 
3. 400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on 
   the track by pressing the first button to set 
   the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the 
   jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle 
   and lose a few tenths of second, or goes 
   completely off-balance and falls, ending the 
   event 
4. High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events 
   where the player starts by setting the bar 
   height, and then mashing the power button to 
   build enough speed. Then, just before the jump 
   point the action button must be pressed and 
   held until the athlete is in position to pass 
   over the bar. The contest ends once there are 
   three misses at an height, or the maximum 
   height is cleared. 
5. Equestrian: The most technical event, the 
   player must steer the horse to the best 
   trajectory while jumping over hurdles and 
   walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty 
   in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump 
   (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) 
   the competition ends immediately. 
6. Javelin: A simple event where each player 
   has three attempts to launch the javelin as far 
   as possible. To do so, first some speed must be 
   built, and a few steps before the mark start 
   pressing the action button to start the launch 
   sequence, which initiates the angle measure. 
   Once the player releases the button (ideally at 
   an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the 
   mark), the javelin is released as well 
7. Cycling: In this sprint event the player 
   must complete a number of laps in the 
   velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close 
   as possible to the inner edge without falling. 
 
Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game 
features the same polygonal environments with 
bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability 
to train or compete in a tournament (up to eight 
human players, with three computer levels and 16 
nations to choose from). It's also possible to 
replay and even store your best (or worst) 
moments.

station. Some levels take place in flight, and 
allow you to not only fly but shoot lasers from 
Superman's eyes. On the ground, you can collect

In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There 
is no longer conventional professional baseball in 
2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball 
Association has been very popular and is the best 
sport. 
 
However, the truth is that the association has 
used a colossal sum of money to promote Super 
Baseball as show business. They have manipulated 
each player's ability using the control computer 
to secretly decide victory or defeat in every 
game. The players who knew this removed the 
connecting parts of the computer to play their own 
game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to 
be played at Cyber Egg Stadium. 
 
In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with 
new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual 
men, women, or robot players. During play, you can 
make your team stronger with prizes earned from 
amazing catches.

Super Battleship (c) 1993 Synergistic Software,

This game features two different modes of play: 
Classic Battleship and Super Battleship. 
 
Classic Battleship is the typical Battleship game 
where the players set up their ships on a grid, 
then take turns choosing 3 places at a time to 
target and hope they hit the opposing players 
ship. The game ends when all the opposing players 
ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty 
levels: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, and 
Admiral. 
 
Super Battleship involves eight levels consisting 
of sixteen missions total. Missions include 
sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, 
escorting ships to their destinations, defending 
cities from attack, and destroying enemy 
airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based 
moving of ships utilizing an overhead view. The 
player can then target any enemy units within the 
ship's range and attack. Attacking brings up an 
action sequence where both ships trade volleys of 
gunfire until one of them either sinks or 
retreats.

In February 1991, The United States of America 
sent troops into Kuwait and fought in armed combat 
against the forces of Iraq. Operation Desert Storm 
featured many different types of units including 
mobile armor. The M1 Abrams tank division is 
deployed in a variety of missions to destroy 
marked Iraqi targets. 
 
Super Battletank: War in the Gulf is a 1st person

left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. 
The goal of the player is to travel to the 
location of enemy targets, line them up with the 
Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. 
Each mission covers a large area of land and the 
player will need to consult the real-time map to 
travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 
Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The 
laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, 
and the smoke screen which allows the player to

Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in 
SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The 
game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but 
many of the 35 included maps are unique to this 
release, including several based on Phantasy Star. 
There is no scenario mode, and any of the included 
maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, 
some for four, and any map can be played with any 
combination of human and computer players. 
 
The game is played on a large map made up of 
hexagonal spaces, each of which is a specific type 
of terrain. Each player controls a number of 
units, which each take up one space on the grid. 
Different units have different strengths and 
weaknesses toward other units, which are also 
affected by the terrain. Each player controls a 
capital, and the goal is to capture the other 
players' capitals.

appears in the Menon planet, home of the evil 
Menon empire and thus a new threat looms over the 
Fantasy Zone. 
 
In a sudden strike by the Menon forces O-Papa, 
Opa-Opa's father, is fatally wounded. Thus Opa-Opa 
once again sets forth to destroy the Menon empire 
and avenge his father. 
 
Gameplay is identical to the previous games, you 
control Opa-Opa on a freely scrolling 2D game 
world and you must seek and destroy all the enemy 
generators in each level in classic arcade shooter 
fashion and then face a boss fight. Upon 
successful completion of a level, you get to spend 
the coins you collected on it at an upgrade shop, 
fitting your ship with better weapons and 
upgrades, and then you head out for the next 
level. 
 
Small changes in gameplay include the removal of 
the automatic orientation control as in the Game 
Gear Fantasy Zone, expanded control mapping that 
takes advantage of the Mega Drive's extra buttons, 
and more weapons and items to upgrade your ship 
with.

This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle 
racing arcade game.  In this game you race a 
motorcycle around the world, completing each 
section of track within a time limit. There are 
other bikes on the road, but beating this is not 
important, so they can be thought of as moving 
obstacles. Each continent is a different 
difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is 
junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is 
expert. 
 
This is a very simple and straightforward game, 
viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen 
does not tilt with the bike). The right/left 
controls are steering, and up/down are gear 
changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your 
speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, 
although contact or running off the road slows the 
bike down.

A long time ago, evil descended upon the peaceful 
people of Hydlide. Old legends tell of a lone 
brave hero who saved Hydlide from the imminent 
threat of doom - the evil demon Varalys. Since 
then, the people of Hydlide have lived through 
centuries of peace. But one dark evening, a huge 
column of fire exploded out of the depths of 
Hydlide. The next morning, strange doors began to 
appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered 
these doors, but were never seen again. From that 
day on, unusual events and disasters began to take 
place. Huge cracks opened in the ground, scarring 
the beautiful lands, floods wiped out entire 
villages. And then the monsters came. The Hydlide 
council feared that the same evil in the legends 
was back again. A wise old oracle predicted the 
second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young 
man who could save Hydlide from the grave danger. 
This young man is you... 
 
Super Hydlide continues the tradition of action 
RPGs started with the original Hydlide for NES. 
You can choose to play as one of the four 
character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and 
Monk. In combat, you use melee or long-ranged 
weapons or cast magic spells in real time. There 
is an internal clock in the game that makes it 
necessary for you to sleep periodically to regain 
your strength. You also have to eat from time to 
time, otherwise your hit points will gradually 
decrease.

Codemasters Software Company Limited, The 
 
A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of 
features, and one of the last multi-format games 
to have roots on the Amiga. 
 
A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 
cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on 
offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on 
more powerful machines - with up to 3 different 
models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or 
faster) and use them to display the track across 2 
separate screens. There were two novelty options 
of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance 
to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - 
using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was 
a skill worth mastering. 
 
24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls 
around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, 
and most of them have parts which cross with other 
parts, making collisions possible if you're much 
ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately 
there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards 
or backwards - perhaps the first game with this 
feature available. You could either run single 
races, or one of the in-built championships - one 
for each car, across a specially selected set of 
tracks. 
 
The customizable nature of the game goes even 
further - the number of laps can be set, as can 
the colour and power of the cars. As you 
repeatedly race a track, the markings on the 
course are eroded by the cars running over them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain 
of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It 
retains that game's frantic style of play and 
two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of 
gore, violence, a hint of satire and that 
all-important two player mode.

This follow-up to Thunder Blade is very similar to 
the original arcade game. Get into your helicopter 
and blast away at the numerous enemies with your 
cannon and missiles. The four stages all follow a 
similar pattern: the first part is from a 
perspective behind your helicopter where you not 
only have to dodge enemy fire but also obstacles 
like buildings or caves. In between, face off 
against one or two smaller boss enemies. When the 
first part of a level is finished, the view 
switches to an overhead perspective for the 
confrontation with the level end boss.

Surging Aura (c) Mar 17, 1995 Japan Media 
Programming Inc. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
In "Surging Aura", you play the role of the young 
prince Muu, son of the king of the country 
Pasfelda. One day, during a major ceremony, the 
kingdom is attacked by an army of monsters. The 
royal wizard has no choice but to use cursed 
magic. As a result, the mighty demon Rufid appears 
and challenges the prince to battle. Defeated by 
the demon, the prince is saved by a mysterious 
force, and is teleported out of the town, to a 
remote village, where his adventure truly begins. 
 
"Surging Aura" is Japanese RPG in animé style. 
Regular enemies are random, and the battles are 
fought from first person view. The combat is is a 
mixture between turn based and real time styles, 
like in contemporary  Final Fantasy games. Enemies 
will attack even if you don't perform any action 
during the battle. The game features full screen 
animé-style pictures as cut scenes

used to their full effect if you are to make 
progress. The game features digitised sound and

these companies.  It is your job to take control 
away from the competitors.  The job is not one of

control.  Advance your way to the top of the 
corporation by successfully completing your 
missions and managing the money you make from your 
territories. 
 
The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, 
with an angled top-down perspective, but it is 
real time rather than turn based. You have 
missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to 
seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a 
team of four agents as they move through the world 
shooting at anything that gets in their way. 
 
You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as 
equip them with tools you have researched or 
liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you

purchasing agents or researching upgrades and 
equipment.

T2 - The Arcade Game (c) 1993 Midway / Arena 
   Entertainment 
 
As the title states, this is the home conversion 
of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film 
Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players 
shoot through future and present levels as robotic 
killers reprogrammed to serve the human 
resistance. 
 
Both players wield a machine gun with infinite 
ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it 
is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile 
launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) 
has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups 
inside the game world include secondary weapon 
ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are 
shot to be collected. 
 
T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on 
specific scenes or general concepts in the film. 
The first four levels act as a prelude, as the 
player guns down waves of metal Terminators across 
a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human 
Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of 
the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying 
the computer, players travel back in time to 
protect John and Sarah Connor, while also 
destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the 
headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, 
players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 
until the final showdown in the Steel Mill. 
 
Assets from the movie are used when possible, such 
as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and 
close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the 
final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and 
SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer 
and Super Scope, respectively).

(over 320).  One or two players can compete in 
regular, reduced, or short seasons, or play an

scrolling, digitized speech and cinemas, along 
with a free throw point of view, add drama to the 
proceedings.  Besides the expected elements of 
basketball (substitutions, penalties, steals and 
blocks, time-outs, overtime), Super NBA gives you 
the chance to call offensive plays and to program 
win/loss records.  Has a battery to back-up season 
play.

Tecmo World Cup '92 (c) 1992 Technos Japan Corp. / 
PAL SOFT 
 
This soccer game was made at the time when 
Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and 
was probably made for the four playing purpose. 
This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or 
more players. Then you can choose between many 
different ground layers, like ice, grass and 
stone, which adds to the replayability. 
 
When you play a one player game you play the world 
cup as one of the top soccer countries of that 
time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. 
Cameroon in the first match and the final is 
against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you 
lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time 
whatsoever. 
 
In the game you always steer only one character, 
which you choose before the match starts. You can 
then give simple orders to you team-mates, like 
pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also 
limited to these moves. The game is totally 
lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles 
without a wink from the referee. Probably it was 
made this way to be funnier to play against 
friends.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Tournament Fighters 
(c) 1993 Konami Co., Ltd. / Konami (America), Inc. 
 
The game features the original 4 turtles from the 
previous games in the series, as well as other 
fighters. 
 
The game is very much in the tradition of the 
Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting 
you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters 
(besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as 
the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called 
"Cyber-Shredder" here). 
 
Though even people familiar with the turtles will 
see differences in them. They can now, for 
example, do moves involving projectiles, such as 
"fireballs". 
 
The game's modes include a story mode, where you 
can only pick one of the turtles and go on 
fighting opponents in order to rescue April and 
Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight 
only for the fame and money.

   In addition to the now-defunct online mode, it 
   can be played single-player offline with an 
   exhibition match, as well as a "pennant mode" 
   where the player builds their own team and 
   plays through a full season. There is also the

The Terminator licensed game for the Sega consoles

game. However, the game's six levels mirror the 
story-line of The Terminator movie very closely as 
you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest 
to save Sarah Connor from termination. 
 
Because the game follows the movie so closely, the 
first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet

hardest and something that most players remember 
with love/hate.

Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous 
block-stacking game, this one is based on the 1988 
coin-op version produced by Sega. The goal is to 
place pieces made up of four tiles in a 
ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete 
rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, 
the pace of the game increases and the background 
changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches 
the top of the well. 
 
In addition to a standard endless mode for one or 
two players, the game also includes a "time trial" 
mode for one or two players, where the goal is to 
get as many points as possible in three minutes. 
There is also a "doubles" mode, where two players 
work together to fill lines in an extra-wide well, 
each controlling their own pieces simultaneously. 
 
The game offers a number of standard options: 
setting the starting level, how much "garbage" is 
at the bottom of the well when the game starts, 
and whether the next piece is visible. There are 
also optional "item blocks," which are special 
flashing pieces that give an extra bonus if they 
are used to clear a line.

Theme Park (c) 1995 Bullfrog Productions, Ltd. / 
Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park 
ownership is your goal in this strategy game from 
Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides 
within the available land, structuring convenient 
paths and queues and ideally leaving some space 
for bigger rides once they become available, and 
include some lakes and trees to increase the 
park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and 
Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate 
roller-coaster you can design, and water rides 
that loop around other rides. 
 
Shops must also be included, so that the visitors 
can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning 
player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine 
settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must 
be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and 
they will only work for what they consider a fair 
rate of pay. 
 
You are competing against other Theme Parks, so 
don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor 
your success in attracting customers and financial 
viability closely using the supplied statistics 
pages. More important, ensure that research is 
adequately funded to produce new rides. 
 
It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level 
lets you concentrate on the park design elements, 
while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

Thunder Force II is both a side scrolling and top

some stages the action is side scrolling and in 
others it is top down (overhead). The weapons 
systems is fairly basic. You can switch from 
shooting a more powerful weapon straight ahead or 
two less powerful guns shooting forward and 
backward simultaneously. There are various 
power-ups that improve your fire power. 
 
In the top down levels you can only travel in 
cardinal directions and cannot maneuver around 
obstacles easily or slow down. The control in the 
side scrolling levels is reminiscent of R-Type or 
Gradius, but with more basic weapons systems. In 
future incarnations of the series the top down 
aspect would be abandoned.

This is a strategy RPG based on the events of the

Margins, also known as Outlaws of the Marsh), 
which tells the story of 108 heroes who fought 
against the corrupt regime of the Song dynasty

Song Jiang, a famous robber and the leader of the 
heroes, starting as the young Zhao He. Their town 
is under attack by imperial soldiers, and their 
long quest for freedom begins with this battle... 
 
The game is a console-style turn-based strategy 
RPG. The game mainly consists of large battles, 
but you can also move your characters from 
top-down perspective, enter buildings, buy things, 
and travel from town to town on the world map. 
During the battles, you move your characters 
freely around the location and attack or cast

Inc. / Black Pearl Software 
 
Time Killers is a one-on-one versus beat-em-up 
with gameplay in a similar vein as Mortal Kombat 
and Street Fighter 2. 
 
What is primarily different is that you can attack 
with all body parts - the head, both arms and both 
legs. A damage system allows arms to be hacked 
off, but fighters can keep going with only legs 
and the head. A special feature allows the 
characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver 
called a 'death move' (similar to Barbarian), at 
any time during a round, instantly killing an 
opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The 
game features cartoon-like over-the-top blood and 
gore violence. 
 
There are eight selectable characters, and each 
one has unique weapons and attributes pertaining 
to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is 
a caveman with a stone axe from 20,000 BC, Musashi 
is a samurai from Feudal Japan 1496, Orion is an 
intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword 
from 2885 etc. 
 
In the single player game, if you manage to defeat 
all standard opponents, you can face off against 
Death himself.

Montana Max swipes the map, and goes after the 
treasure himself.  He also gets Dr. Gene Splicer 
to brainwash most of Buster's friends, and kidnaps 
the rest of them!  Buster has to reclaim his map, 
his treasure, and save everyone while he's at it! 
 
Buster's Hidden Treasure is a platform game 
starring Buster and many other Tiny Toons 
characters.  As Buster, players run through each 
level, jumping on enemies to defeat them.  Buster 
can also pick up carrots - for every fifty he 
collects, he gets a helper friend which can be 
used to destroy all enemies on the screen.  
Although Buster only starts the game with three 
hearts, his health meter can be increased by 
collecting bells. 
 
The goal of each level is to find Gogo Dodo, who 
will let Buster exit the level.  Similar to Super 
Mario World, Buster's Hidden Treasure has a world 
map that you can select your level from.  Also 
similar to Mario World, some levels contain hidden 
exits, creating shortcuts, or granting players 
access to tougher levels.

Todd's Adventures in Slime World (c) Sep 10, 1991 
Epyx, Inc. / Micro World 
 
While flying your spaceship, you crash land on a 
planet covered entirely in slime.  You and a 
friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, 
armed with a water pistol and all manner of 
gadgets you find along the way in an effort to 
find your way back out.  The game world is a giant 
maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of 
original layout ideas.  Depending on the game 
mode, you are either cooperating or competing with 
your "friend" to find and get to an exit first.  
Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds 
(about 6 entries to choose from), games often take 
several hours to complete. 
 
The basis of the game is exploration, with varying 
game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle 
solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.

ToeJam & Earl (c) 1991 Johnson-Voorsanger 
Productions / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Toejam and Earl are two hip aliens from the planet 
Funkotron. One day, they are cruisin' their galaxy 
in the sweet spaceship ride. Unfortunately, Earl 
wasn't paying enough attention to where he was 
driving, and ran the ship into an asteroid.  The 
ship crash landed onto the most bizarre planet in 
the galaxy: Earth. 
 
Toejam and Earl must travel from level to level on 
Earth and collect the 10 scattered pieces of the 
ship. But the various Earthlings, such as Nerd 
Herds, Giant Hamsters, Phantom Ice Cream Trucks 
and the Bogeyman will make that difficult. 
 
The power up items that TJ and E can pick up come 
in the form of wrapped presents. You never really 
know what a power up is until you open it. What's 
more, randomized levels and item locations make it 
a different game every time. 
 
The game features a dynamic screen splitting - 
screen joining 2-player mode. 
Players start the game close to each other. If one 
gets away from the other, the screen vertically 
splits to allow each player to move freely. When 
players are close again, the screens join together 
to become one single screen.

ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (c) 1993 
ToeJam & Earl Productions, Inc. / SEGA of America,

The sequel to ToeJam & Earl starts off where the 
first game ends. The two funky aliens have finally 
gathered all their rocket parts and left Earth for 
their home planet Funkotron. Accidentally, some 
earthlings manage to cling on to their spaceship 
and come along to Funkotron with them. 
 
Being responsible for the huge disturbance the 
humans are causing on their funky planet, the duo 
set off to clean up the mess. 
 
The earthlings come in all sorts of surprising 
forms, kids running around, construction workers, 
tourists, and the regular wierdos. You can choose 
either character, or have two players play out 
together, as you hit the earthlings with special 
jars that suck them in, so they cud be transported 
back to Earth. 
 
You meet other Funkotron inhabitants and interact 
with them, things like helping them find stuff or 
ringing their doorbell and running away! All these 
people will help you in getting the job done and 
preventing Funkotron from losing its funky-ness.

Tommy Lasorda Baseball (c) 1989 SEGA Enterprises 
Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
This was the first 16-bit baseball cart on the 
market. Play alone or with a friend. Choose from 
any of the 26 major league teams. The game uses 
all of the real-life city names, but the stats and 
player names are fictional. 
 
Once on the field, game play follows standard 
baseball rules. The password feature enables you 
to take your team all the way through a season to 
the World Series. The game also tracks all of the 
other teams in the league simultaneously. 
 
Batters in the game are rated according to batting 
average, home runs, running speed, and fielding 
and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, 
curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing 
speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. 
All the ratings make this game a challenge to your 
managerial ability as well as your gaming skill 
because you're calling the shots from the dugout. 
 
The option screen enables you to decide how tough 
your computer opponent will be. You can play a 
pitcher's duel, a batter's slug fest, or a normal 
game. Decide whether there'll be fielding errors 
and determine how the wind will affect the hit 
balls. This game covers about every detail, right 
down to umps who shout "safe" or "out."

Top Gear 2 (c) 1994 Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. 
/ Kotobuki System Co., Ltd. 
 
This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's 
earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look 
and feel, right down to the text font used in the 
game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, 
each of which features four races, with many 
real-world circuits recreated in incongruous 
locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, 
and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 
 
These four-race blocks each represent their own 
mini-championship, in which you race against 19 
cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, 
and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, 
and the respective amount of money in thousands. 
This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging 
from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks 
(front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal 
approach is to buy the more expensive versions 
ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you 
win the four-race championship, you get the next 
password. 
 
You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during 
each race, although bonus nitros, money and 
instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. 
Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are 
also frequent.

Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter

the enemies along the way. You only get a standard 
gun on your plane, and no bombs! Instead of bombs 
you can call helper planes. These planes make a 
formation around you and help to shoot all 
enemies. 
 
Along the way you get the chance to collect 
power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these 
are destroyed they release a power-up. There are 3 
types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you 
get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you 
get more calls for helper planes. And third are 
extra lives.

Tyrants - Fight Through Time (c) 1992 Sensible 
Software / Virgin Games, Inc. 
 
First you choose one out of four different 
characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), 
Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or 
Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 
levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories 
which can be completed in any other, while the 
final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own 
surprises. 
 
Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start 
with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you 
find necessary on each island. The rest men left 
will go to another level with another new 100. In 
the second half of the game you can freeze men to 
save them for the Mother of All Battles. 
 
Once you select your island and place for your HQ, 
you must do some research for better weapons and 
defences. On the roof of your buildings you can 
put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil 
men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send 
a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, 
they will build an additional base there, with 
larger armies completing this more quickly. 
 
Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines 
and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain 
material for higher level weapons, depending on 
whether the area you're on is rich with a certain 
material or not. With each next level, you'll 
start from a higher technology level and be able 
to progress to one higher level up then the at 
previous level. 
 
If there is more then just one enemy, you can make 
an alliance until you crush the other one - three 
of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. 
For what its worth, a certain numeric level of 
defence is always stronger from the same level of 
attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) 
can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or 
attack enemy fort. 
 
The main thing as it always is in strategy games 
is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to 
victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, 
equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out 
of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to 
dominate the world and crush your opponents. 
 
You can do the battling only in a certain 
quadrant, but don't be long as your men will 
automatically start building the fort, and it will 
be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to 
invent everything for that one again.

Atlantal, a peaceful planet, has been attacked by 
an invading alien fleet known only as The 
Aggressors, leaving the capital city Delila in 
ruins. In order to sop The Aggressors, the people 
of Atlantal send the most powerful fighter ship on 
the planet, the bio-ship Gomorrah. 
 
Uchu Senkan Gomorrah (Space Battle Ship Gomorrah) 
is a horizontally-scrolling shooter based on the 
1990 coin-op of the same title. The player 
controls the titular ship, Gomorrah, which can 
shoot both straight forward as in most shooting 
games, as well as freely in any direction via an 
aiming cursor, which is controlled independently 
of the ship itself. Additionally, there are 
several power-ups that can be found, including 
speed-ups, additional mounted guns, and the 
life-up, which will not only increase the ship's 
armor, but also cause it to grow in size as well. 
 
The game features 9 stages, each with a boss at 
the end, as well as one or two-player simultaneous 
play. The game difficulty has been rebalanced from 
the arcade to compensate for the lack of a 
trackball to control the aiming cursor

Ultimate Qix (c) 1991 Taito Corporation / Taito 
Software Inc. 
 
Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op 
developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is 
very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of 
an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, 
forming shapes and removing them from the play 
field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually 
revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The 
borders of the area which the player has not 
cleared become the border of the area the player's 
pointer can move along. 
 
The player's object must avoid contact with any of 
the enemies which float around the screen, as this 
will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers 
limit which parts of the border boxes can be 
formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more 
of the screen, and each additional percent adds 
bonus points. 
 
As an arcade conversion this game allows for one 
or two player games in three difficulty levels, 
but offers no passwords or saved games across its 
numerous levels.

Ultimate Soccer (c) 1993 Rage Software Ltd. / SEGA 
Europe Ltd. 
 
Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game 
composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, 
each with it's own values for running, ball 
control and strength. There are five game modes 
(friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff 
and league), but the lack of password or built-in 
battery means each one of them must be completed 
in one sitting. 
 
The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' 
preference by changing several key aspects of the 
physics engine, such as wind strength and 
direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel 
higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to 
be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely 
lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet 
grass), tightness of ball control and players 
speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the 
ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks 
to the many options regarding the physics, the 
game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, 
from building up the play with small passes from 
the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope 
of a goalmouth deflection. 
 
Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden 
NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the 
view to be tilted up to show more detail up front 
or tilted down to show more of the field. 
 
The series later continued with Striker on the 
same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and 
PlayStation.

incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can

material. Cast in the role of the titular 
Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same 
monsters that appeared in the original series. 
Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, 
Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his 
opponent, as well as use a variety of various 
special moves that must be charged. However, in 
order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman 
must deplete their continually-recharging life 
bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful 
special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game 
continues, different enemies may even find ways to 
avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman 
must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only 
three minutes, and there are three lives and no

The future of the human race looks hopeless when 
maintenance drones accidentally replace the orbot 
leader's head with a salvaged atomic bomb. All the 
orbots on Earth are immediately ordered, via 
television receivers, to stop cleaning up the 
planet and to start manufacturing weapons for an 
impending ambush of the returning humans. Only one 
orbot, a sludge barge pilot who was out of 
communications range, is unaffected by the evil 
take-over. You are that pilot: VectorMan! The only 
hope of the entire human race is for you to 
destroy the villainous WarHead: you must seek him 
out by following a trail of television receivers 
around the Earth, and then confront him in a 
battle that will decide the fate of humanity, and 
of the planet Earth itself!

The game consists of three side-scrolling platform 
stages and three stages that take place from a 
rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, 
dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He 
tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water

post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three 
remaining stages. They are all accessed by chance 
via a wheel-of-misfortune.

One year after the first edition of the World 
Fighting Tournament, won by Lau Chan, invitations 
are sent once again, this time to the second 
edition of the Tournament. Will Akira's new 
techniques be enough to beat Wolf? Can Lau defend 
his title against his daughter Pai? Will Jacky 
rescue his sister Sarah, who has been brainwashed 
to kill him? Will Jeffry make enough money to 
track down the Satan Shark? And Kage, will he 
uncover if the mysterious Judgement 6 cartel is 
behind the tournament? All is yet to be seen... 
 
Sharing the name with the second title in Sega's 
seminal 3D fighter series, this 16-bit version 
brings the game to the world of 2D fighters. 
 
While the fully polygonal environment of the 
arcade/saturn version were scratched in favor of 
regular sprites and side-scrolling camera due to 
obvious technological constraints (plus  
manufacturing costs ruling out the SVP chip used 
in Virtua Racing) and featuring only the 8 
original characters in the series, the rest was 
directly taken or inspired by it's bigger brother. 
The arenas are all drawn according to the to the 
32-bit titles (and even feature a small parallax 
scrolling trick to provide a slight 3D illusion), 
so are the characters, and the also features a lot 
of the same sound effects and music. Gameplay is 
also inspired by the original version, with many 
button combinations remaining unchanged.

Virtua Racing (c) 1994 SEGA-AM2 Co., LTD. / SEGA 
of America, Inc. 
 
Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega's first ever 
3D, polygon-based racing game for the arcade. The 
game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars 
around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, 
competing against a second player or computer 
drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game 
controls are very "arcadey" and players can see 
the leap they made from here to Daytona. 
 
The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is 
of note as it is the only game for the system 
which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua 
Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into 
each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D 
capability) and is very similar to the SNES's 
SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and 
Stunt Race FX.

Vixen 357 (c) Oct 23, 1992 Masaya / NCS 
Corporation 
 
In 2384 AD, a great interstellar war took place. 
The Earth emerged victorious, thanks to a secretly 
developed robot weapon called "Serd". After the 
war, the usage of Serds was not a secret any more, 
and various nations started using them for 
military purposes. Several years, a more powerful 
weapon named Vector was developed. The usage of 
such highly destructive weapons led to wars 
between the nations of the world. You control 
Takuya Murasawa and his comrades, member of a 
special military force called Slash. Everything 
begins with an attack of unidentified Vectors on 
their base... 
 
"Vixen 357" is an animé-style strategy/RPG game 
with mech combat. You control your robots by 
moving them over the battle map, and fighting 
enemies with long-ranged or melée attacks. An 
animated battle sequence is shown when you and 
enemy robots attack each other. You can switch 
pilots in the robots and repair them during 
battles. Your pilots level up by gaining 
experience points, and you'll be able to acquire 
new robots and weapons during the game.

one of the three different Troopers to kick, punch 
and use special abilities to defeat a fighter to 
advance to the next one.  Each Trooper has their 
own strengths, weaknesses and special moves and 
each has their own separate stages, depending on 
which the player chooses.  It also has multi

head-to-head in a Duel Mode.

These levels are set at various New York locations 
including a TV studio and a circus that wants to 
keep the dinosaurs as an exhibit. Every other 
level is a 3D level where you play one of the 
dinosaur characters, e.g. skateboarding on the 
back of a pickup truck as Rex or flying as Elsa 
over central park while collecting balloons. This 
is one of the earliest Genesis games with 3D

coin-operated redemption game Whac-A-Mole. Each 
stage has nine holes, out of which various 
creatures appear. The player must hit as many of 
the "bad" creatures as possible, while leaving the 
princess and the dog untouched. Some creatures 
wear helmets and must be hit several times to be 
defeated. Between each stage, there are minigames 
where bonus points can be earned, and there are 
six stages total. Also supported is a special 
nine-button "Smash Controller" specific to this 
game.

Whip Rush 2222 AD (c) 1990 Vic Tokai Corporation / 
Renovation Products, Inc. 
 
Whip Rush is a side-scrolling (with certain 
vertically scrolling descents and ascents) shooter 
similar to Gaiares and R-Type. 
 
You start with 3, 4 or 6 ships depending on the 
difficulty level you select. 
 
In addition to moving and shooting, your ship has 
Power Claws that you can rotate and extend for 
offensive and defensive purposes. Power Claws can 
be equipped up to two units and can shoot bullets. 
 
The upgradeable weapons are Laser, Missile, 
Fireball and Power Claw. 
 
Laser is forward firing only but is rapid and 
strong, missiles can shoot back and forth and when 
shot from the Power Claw they will home in on 
enemies. Fireballs shoot in the opposite direction 
of your ships travel. 
 
Unlike most other games, your ship has variable 
speed, which comes in handy when negotiating 
different kinds of obstacles and enemies.

Wings of Wor (c) Sep 08, 1991 Masaya / DreamWorks 
 
Gynoug is a horror-themed shoot'em up similar to 
Thunder Force and other horizontal shooters. But 
other than most of them where you play a spaceship 
of some sort, here you play as Wor, a member of 
the so-called 'Flying men' who look quite similar 
to angels. 
The home planet of these people, Iccus, has been 
taken over by a virus that has mutated into a 
collection of quite horrible creatures, and every 
previous attempt to battle them has failed. So now 
it is Wor's turn to save his home planet and 
destroy these mutants once and for all! 
 
Gynoug consists of 6 levels with no check points, 
instead you continue right where you died if you 
have any lifes left. Each level (except the last) 
has a mid-boss and a large end-boss. There are 
three types of shots, one that fires in a 
triangular fashion, one that fires more 
concentrated in a corridor and a bit to the back 
and above/below you, and one that fires to the 
front and back simultaneously. You can power them 
up in two ways, by shooting more bullets and by 
strengthening them. Also, feathers can increase 
your speed like in Gradius.

Winter Challenge (c) 1992 MindSpan / Ballistic 
 
An Olympiad game simulating common winter game 
competitions - the Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge, 
2-men Bobsled, Ski Jump, Cross Country, Biathlon 
and Speed Skating. 
 
The game features a basic 3D engine which allows 
to simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the 
gameplay of some events such as the Downhill. 
Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, 
relies on finding the faster trajectories in most 
events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), 
pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and 
Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with 
button mashing reserved for just one (speed 
skating). The player (up to ten) can select his 
(or her) competitor face and nationality from one 
of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different 
difficulty settings, different computer controlled 
athletes take part in the competition along the 
player.

Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair (c) 1990 Westone 
Co., Ltd. / SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different 
game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy 
series. You play a green-haired dude who must 
attack the invaders that attempt to collect 
weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game 
starts out like a simple platform game, but it's 
just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on 
that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, 
so basically the gameplay consists of action and 
shooter scenes. 
 
In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as 
you make your way towards the skull, but this can 
be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of 
weapons can be picked up, and not only does these 
allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount 
of time, but they also increase your vitality. 
 
In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend 
as you make your way through the scene. Here, your 
vitality remains static unless you are hit by an 
enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss 
waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. 
Every boss changes color to show how much damage 
has been done to it. You have to defeat some 
bosses in two stages. 
 
If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll 
lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder 
Girl join you, as two players can play the game.

This soccer game lets you choose a team

tournament. This is identical to the real 1990

Once you pick your team you can also select which

Also provided are modes for single exhibition

The action is viewed from above with large player 
sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are 
no free kicks. Whereas later sports games often 
carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this 
game is rather simplified -- you can only control 
the player closest to the ball, for example, and 
it is missing many of the rules of soccer such as 
penalty flags and offsides.

give a better view of the action if you are 
blocked in.  Your available moves are punch, kick, 
and grab.  You must try to wear down your

Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is 
structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is 
very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. 
Also, each match is divided into a series of 
rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each 
round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when 
you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by 
reducing their energy meter. Game modes include 
single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs 
mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, 
filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a

The first part of the game has an organic feel to

Beggar Prince (Xin Qigai Wangzi) is a Chinese-made 
RPG loosely based on the famous novel by Mark 
Twain, Prince and the Pauper. A young prince is 
bored with the life in the palace, and one day 
manages to go outside the gate, distracting the 
guards. In the town he meets a young boy who looks 
very similar to him. The prince offers him to 
switch their clothes, because he wants to spend 
the day as an ordinary boy. But when he comes back 
to the palace, the guards don't recognize him in 
his beggar's clothes and refuse to let him in. A 
new life, full of danger and adventures, begins 
for the young prince... 
 
The game is conceived in the tradition of Japanese 
RPGs. You navigate the prince on the world map and 
around towns, fighting random enemies and 
descending into dungeons. The battles are 
turn-based and are viewed from an isometric 
perspective. You can attack physically or use a 
variety of magic spells, classified in types. In 
the beginning of you turn you have a full SP bar

X-Perts (c) 1995 Abalone / Deep Water 
 
X-Perts was an extension of Sega's Eternal 
  Champions Universe. 
 
It starred one of EC's fighters (Shadow Yamamoto) 
in an unique action adventure game. She lead a 
team of elite X-Perts to do impossible missions. 
The game was a mixture of action, adventure and 
strategy. 
 
X-Perts was set in an futuristic underwater 
  research lab called AQUA, besieged by 
  terrorists. The player controlled 3 characters, 
  each with unique fighting moves and specific 
  skill knowledge. All characters and backgrounds 
  were pre-rendered in 3D, to give it a very high 
  end graphic look. 
 
The player had to react to events happening in the 
lab to progress the game and avoid destruction, 
while battling both the terrorists and the 
stations defenses. 
 
This was done by direct and indirect control of 
the X-Perts through the entire lab (roughly 20 
different levels.) The player used a special RECOM 
screen to monitor his characters placement across 
the separate areas of the lab, as well as all 
mission objectives, enemies, facility robots and 
other hazards. 
 
Using direct control of a character, you would 
move around and between levels and directly combat 
enemies. The player could also activate tasks for 
mission objectives. The time it took to complete a 
task was based on the strength of their 
Engineering and or Computer Science skills. 
 
Missions were constantly being generated and some 
were time dependent (missing it usually meant the 
situation got worse for the X-Perts), so hopping 
between X-Perts and assigning the ones with the 
best skills for the task was important. Some 
secondary missions allowed character upgrades to 
their personal weapons. 
 
Characters could also use 3 unique torture moves 
each to get information from the enemies instead 
of killing them. This would sometimes be needed 
for mission objectives. However, if not executed 
properly, it would instantly kill the enemy 
instead. 
 
The game modeled all 20 levels of the lab in real 
time, so even when you left a character to 
activate another, it would still continue to 
perform its task until it was attacked by enemies, 
and would automatically defend itself, but to a 
lesser extent then if you directly controlled it. 
 
The game was broken down into chapters (save 
points) and each chapter remembered the status of 
the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded 
areas, broken power grids, hacked computers, 
active forcefields.)

Wolf Team 
 
Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game 
set in feudal Japan. 
 
The background for the game's events is the 
ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as 
yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the 
"middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and 
rulers. The player can choose to play as either 
yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. 
 
The player has to manage his army, deploying units 
for protection and attack, as well as negotiating 
with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, 
plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't 
always work, so battles against enemy armies 
occupy a large portion of the game. The battles 
are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs 
(though the game has no RPG elements): the player 
chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use 
magic, use special technique, use a battle 
formation, etc. There is no active movement during 
the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on 
the chosen commands as well as on the strength of 
the units.

Zero Wing (c) May 31, 1991 Toaplan Co., Ltd. / 
Toaplan Co., Ltd. 
 
Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the 
player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod 
released after its main ship was attacked and 
destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking 
over the world. 
 
Like most games in the genre, there are three 
color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) 
and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of 
power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must 
be collected sequentially. However, what makes the 
game unique is the ability to use a traction beam 
to trap an enemy and then throw him against his 
peers, destroying them. 
 
The game (or the European PAL version) is best 
known for being the origin of the infamous "All 
Your Base" 2001 Internet meme.

the same color as your piece, the shape is 
eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the

versions there is an option to let the cannons 
shoot automatically all the time. 
 
The game is viewed from behind the plane with you 
fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at 
heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics,

barge is hijacked by it's cargo in an escape 
attempt.  The resulting chaos caused the barge to 
crash into a military cruiser. The impact caused 
extensive damage to both ships.  There were only 8 
survivors, 4 from each ship.  What's worse, 
there's only one escape pod.  You control one of 
the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the 
others to escape with your life. 
 
The gameplay in Cosmic carnage is similar to 
Street Fighter 2, but with a much slower pace.  
Some of the fighters can be customized with 
different armor combinations, allowing them access

One of the last 32X games released (and

shooter, inspired in part by the arcade gameplay 
of Asteroids. It is one of the few 32X games to 
used texture-mapped polygons. 
 
Players control a lone starship rushing to destroy 
oncoming asteroids and alien vessels before they 
annihilate defenseless human miners and colonies. 
Asteroids break apart into smaller rocks, which 
much also be hunted down and destroyed. Aliens 
likewise arrive in larger, more dangerous vessels. 
 
Asteroids broken down to their smallest size and 
then vaporized will sometimes drop shield or 
energy recharges, to repair damage caused by laser 
blasts or collisions. New weapons can also be 
found. Players have a time limit to meet all 
objectives in a stage before they are forced to 
land and try again. The right side of the HUD 
shows asteroids remaining (and their approximate 
size), while the left shows the player's distance 
to their base (and so, time remaining in the 
stage).

$bio
 
 
DOOM (32X) (c) 1994 id Software, Inc. / SEGA of 
America, Inc. 
 
The Union Aerospace Corporation has been 
experimenting with teleportation technology on 
Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early 
successes, something goes wrong. It seems the 
scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. 
Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and 
the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of 
marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are 
quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving 
marine to grab some guns and strike back at the 
demons. 
 
id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining 
Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person 
shooter: full-on action seen from the space 
marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game 
consists of distinct episodes, playable in any 
order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, 
takes place in the Phobos base and is freely 
available as shareware. The full game continues on 
Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in 
Inferno, the final episode which takes place in 
Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, 
one of which is a hidden level. 
 
The basic objective in each level is simply to 
reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in 
the way, the only way to get there is through 
killing them. Switches and buttons must be 
pressed to advance at certain points and often 
color-coded locked doors will block the way - 
matching keycards or skull keys must be found to 
pass. 
 
DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than 
Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied 
and complex. The engine simulates different 
heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and 
different lighting conditions (some rooms are 
pitch black, others only barely illuminated). 
There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive 
waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come 
down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's 
orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM 
can be in any angle to each other. An automap 
helps in navigating the levels. 
 
Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic 
theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually 
change to a hellish environment, complete with 
satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses 
and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated 
corpses and the distorted faces of the damned. 
 
DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most 
weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The 
starting weapons are the fists and a simple 
pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, 
slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun 
(high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in 
longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a 
high firing rate and large damage). The rocket 
launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the 
explosion causes blast damage and must be used 
with care in confined areas or it might prove 
deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two 
further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the 
chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the 
BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some 
practice to fire correctly, can destroy most 
enemies in a single burst. The different weapons 
use four different ammunition types (bullets, 
shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting 
the right type for a certain gun is important. 
 
DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired 
aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures 
to be collected for points, but many other 
powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage 
while armor protects from receiving it in the 
first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be 
carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout 
of the level on the automap (including any secret 
areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark 
areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste 
without taking damage. Also available are berserk 
packs (which radically increase the damage 
inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time 
invisibility and invulnerability powerups. 
 
The enemies to be destroyed include former humans 
corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all 
shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating 
skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite 
attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities 
called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss 
battle against one or two especially powerful 
creatures. 
 
DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two 
different modes: Cooperative allows up to four 
players to move through the single-player game 
together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game 
type where players blast at each other to collect 
'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in 
a random location after being killed.

FIFA International Soccer 96 (32X) (c) 1995 
Extended Play Productions / Electronic Arts, Inc. 
 
"Aiming to be the first football simulation that 
is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA 
Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of 
release. It was hailed as the first really 
successful FIFA release, and opened the way for 
yearly revisions of the concept. 
 
There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 
stand out from the crowd of other football sims. 
Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary 
at the time -- the renowned British commentator 
John Motson comments all the incidents and 
happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient 
commentary is varied, and systems with more than 
the minimum memory level get extra commentary 
phrases. 
 
The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous 
pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a 
SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system 
 
FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the 
world, ranging from the unknown players of the 
Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the 
English and Italian leagues. 59 International 
teams are also featured, and it's possible to 
match the teams you want to against each other 
through friendlies, or you can also choose to play 
domestic tournaments or International ones such as 
the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the 
composition of the various teams, you can create 
your own dream team through the custom team 
creator.

Knuckles Chaotix is a spin-off of the Sonic the 
Hedgehog series of Genesis games.  The starring 
character in this title is Knuckles the Echidna, 
who first appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.  
Knuckles works at Carnival Island, an amusement 
park. It's his job to protect the park and make it 
a happy place for visitors. Dr. Robotnik, as 
usual, has an evil plan for the park.  He wants 
the power emerald which supplies electricity to 
the entire island.  What's worse, he has 
imprisoned several of Knuckles' friends in the 
"combi confiner."  This contraption only allows 
Knuckles to free one of his friends at a time be 
attaching a tether between himself and them.  
Therefore, when you play the game you are always 
attached to another character. 
 
Although the basic gameplay of Knuckles Chaotix is 
similar to the Sonic games, the bungee cord 
between the two characters creates new challenges. 
 The new characters that appear are Vector the 
Crocodile, Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the 
Chameleon and Charmy Bee.  There also two 
characters whose sole purpose is to slow you down, 
Heavy the Robot, and Bomb. Chaotix adds several 
new power-ups and 3D bonus levels as well.

Metal Head (32X) (c) 1994 SEGA Enterprises Ltd. / 
SEGA of America, Inc. 
 
It's 5 years after the formation of the Worldwide 
Federation.  Although war has been averted, 
terrorist cells around the world threaten the 
stability of the federation.  To combat this 
menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal 
armored tank known as the Metal Head.  You are a 
Metal Head pilot, and you have to use all the 
weapons at your disposal to take out the 
terrorists. 
 
Metal Head is a bit of a variation on the usual 
giant robot combat game.  The game's mission areas 
bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter 
than a simulation.  The graphics are all rendered 
in texture mapped polygons, which is unusual for a 
32X game.

The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, 
return for a tournament held by the evil Shang 
Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as 
before, and famed for its high level of violence 
and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo 
version). There are 5 difficulty levels and 
optional credits, as well as the usual two player 
mode including same character duels. 
 
To win the main tournament, the player must beat 
each of the other human players, before taking on 
Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. 
Players have a range of punches and kicks 
available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, 
roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for 
each player. These include throws, uppercuts, 
long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a 
teleport feature.

Motocross Championship is the only dirtbike racing

behind-the-bike perspective, and makes use of the 
32X's hardware bitmap scaling to present a 3D

Like the title suggests, the main game mode is a 
points based championship.  You can compete in one 
of 3 motorcycle classes over 12 indoor and outdoor 
tracks.  There's also two player split screen mode 
so you can share off-road fun with a friend.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition (32X) (c) 1995 Midway 
Games, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
This game lets you play two-on-two arcade 
basketball with players from all the NBA teams. 
Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few 
rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic 
jamming. Players are rated on eight ability 
categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 
3-pointers. 
 
Up to four human players can take part, each 
always controlling a single player for their team, 
and AI for missing players. This allows for four 
players to face each other in teams of two, or for 
two players to team up against a third player with 
a CPU team-mate. 
 
The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to 
three players, and allows for substitutions 
between quarters. Shoving players now results in 
injuries, which lower a player's stats

Night Trap (c) 1994 Digital Pictures, Inc. /

Five girls go to a party to a nice house on a 
lakeside. Five girls disappear without a trace... 
Now another five girls go there, in order to spend 
the vacation with the Martins, the owners of the 
house, in particular with the lovely Ms. Martin. 
This time, you should not let them die a gruesome 
death! Because "nice people" can sometimes turn 
out to be... yes, that's right - vampires. The 
whole house is full of traps, that are intended to 
catch the poor innocent girls, so that the 
vampires can suck their blood... ugh. Luckily, the 
brave adventurer is there in order to cease to be 
hunted and to become a hunter instead! Set the 
traps so that they will capture the villains 
themselves, using precise timing and good 
organization. 
 
Night Trap was the very first game that used the 
FMV (full-motion video) technology with live 
actors. Although it didn't contain nudity or 
particularly gory scenes, it was considered one of 
the first games to have a mature content.

baseball games are present and has three different 
game modes to choose from: exhibition, playoff,

different from the others is a lack of MLB 
license, though it does feature a MLBPA license 
with top players of the time such as Roger 
Clemens, Otis Nixon, Bobby Larkin among many 
others. 
 
Though it doesn't have a full MLB license, it 
tries to recreate the MLB experience by omitted 
the teams nicknames but using similar team colors 
and using the actual stadiums and redoing them 
without the distinctive trademarks.  It doesn't 
feature a battery back-up, but does have a 
password feature for a player to pick up and play 
later if they choose.

WWF Wrestlemania Arcade (32X) (c) 1995 Sculptured 
Software, Inc. / Acclaim Entertainment, Inc. 
 
WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the 
personalities and action of the popular WWF TV 
show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style 
fighting game. This title features digitized 
graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, 
Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The 
Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex 
Luger. 
 
Although it is a wrestling title, this game is 
structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is 
very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. 
Also, each match is divided into a series of 
rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each 
round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when 
you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by 
reducing their energy meter. Game modes include 
single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs 
mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.

Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000 (32X) (c) 1995 CSK 
Research Institute Corp. / SEGA Enterprises Ltd. 
 
This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter has gameplay is 
somewhat like Sega arcade classic Zaxxon. The 
graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling 
playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment.  
The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling 
planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn 
using 3D flat-shaded polygons. 
 
Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is 
to shoot everything without getting shot, the game 
has a strategic element.  Your basic spacecraft 
has very little firepower, and can only sustain 
one hit.  To make matters worse, there are very 
few power-ups.  In order to survive, you have to 
jump on top of enemies and take control of their 
weapons systems.  This system allows for a large 
variety of player-controllable ships.
