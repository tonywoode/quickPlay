pgEdit (Packages Generator and Editor) executable has to be placed in this directory.
It can be built from the source pgEdit.dpr located at https://jvcl.svn.sourceforge.net:443/svnroot/jvcl/trunk/jvcl/devtools/PackagesGenerator/
Building this tool requires the installation of the JVCL (http://jvcl.delphi-jedi.org/).
