Description=In a post-apocalyptic future a gambling syndicate seeks to make a quick buck in the gritty remains of earth. By fusing the best of animal and mechanical traits they create three bestial androids from a bird, a lion, and a rhinoceros. Bets are taken and then the robots are loosed into hostile mazes of scrap metal on old earth. Maybe they'll even make it back alive...<br><br>The goal of BUFFERS EVOLUTION is to run through a course while collecting ten parts in the best time possible. The courses are large and vary between jungle scenes, deserts, old factories, and general mechanical wastes. These areas are cased in by electricity to stop the contests from escaping and thereby ruining the entertainment of the masses. This will keep you in the bounds of the course. With the press of a button your character will momentarily turn into a 'buffer', a sharp pisiform metallic object, while being a buffer you can destroy enemies by slamming into them, this will often bounce you in a given direction, which is useful for reaching high ledges. <br><br>Although you do not need to get all the parts to clear an area special items can be accrued by collection parts, while on the course proper these parts will heal any damage you may have taken. Perhaps if you collect all the part in all nine areas you'll have the means to escape you captors? <br><br>Gameplay is reminiscent of Sonic the Hedghog<br> although in those games you race against a countdown while here you are merely trying to get good times.

The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. <br><br>Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter.

Description=Engacho is based on a popular Japanese children game. You play a little boy named Sunzuki, who wants to prove to his angry father that he is not a coward and can stand up against the terrible monsters of the Oops Five group. Those five guys are extremely ugly and can contaminate you with an awful disease the moment they touch you. So you should outsmart them and run away before they can catch you. The gameplay is turn-based. You enter a room with the Oops Five monsters, and move in different directions, trying to avoid collision. The catch is that each monster has his own movement style. One of them will always imitate Sunzuki and move into the same direction as he; another will, on the contrary, move into the opposite direction, etc. By planning ahead, you must be smart enough to make your moves correctly and make it to the exit before Oops Five get you. There are different modes in the game, such as training, in which you face just one monster of your choice and get used to his patterns; puzzle mode, which takes you through a series of rooms with different shapes and monsters; and battle mode, in which you are thrown into large rooms where all Oops Five members roam freely.

Description=Ganso JaJaMaru-kun is a remake of the NES platformer Ninja JaJaMaru-kun. It includes new levels and bosses that stretch the gameplay in novel ways.<br><br>Lord Namazu Dayuu has kidnapped JaJaMaru-kun's beloved Princess Sakura. This piratical lord is no laughing matter, despite his sadistically gleeful disposition, he possess an army of creatures drawn from Japanese folklore to prevent you from reuniting with your princess ever again.<br><br>The game is quite simple and plays, for the most part, much like its predecessor. Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick points in that Jajamaru-kun can break by hitting them with his head while, a common trait for arcade heroes. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.<br><br>Each of these stages has a leader who will posses some special attribute and present a new sprite. After the level in which the leader appears he/she/it will show up in the following levels as a standard level enemy often a bit weaker. Each stage gives you two minutes to complete it, except bosses and special stages. When about one minute remains Lord Namazu will send an orb of fire onto the stage that will slowly home after Jajamaru-kun.<br><br>You start the game with two extra lives and three continues. More lives can be found in the game, or by accruing points.  <br><br>There are four levels in each game area, village, graveyard, castle and town, seaside and ship, and the hidden island. However it is not enough to kill all the enemies in a stage to progress to the next area. Each level has its a cherry blossom that will descend from the top of the screen at a certain point. If you should kill all the enemies before the blossom arrives or the blossom floats of the bottom of the screen you'll go onto the next level but have to return to get it later, in this case all the enemies will have returned. Collecting all four cherry blossoms will allow you to go onto a special stage and the area boss.<br><br>Each game area has one special stage. These stages use the familiar tiers but now they scroll upwards and are littered with traps and hazards; such as, wheels of fire, falling logs, spikes, conveyor belts, etc.. As the scrolling is automatic should Jajamaru-kun not keep up and fall off the bottom of the screen he will die, touching any deadly hazard will also dispatch our hero. Should the player reach the top of the tiers he will be confronted with a gate that his shuriken will open, this leads to a boss.<br><br>Each area boss is attacked in a unique boxed in area, sometimes with platforms. The final boss is the only area where Jajamaru-kun may throw his shuriken vertically. There are no power-ups in boss rooms.<br><br>The power-ups that can be found in the bricks between tiers wear out after a certain amount of time, with the exception of the frog. They will appear on the upper right hand corner of the screen so you know which ones you've picked up recently, getting the frog clears this list.<br><br>1. Invisibility potion: an invisible ninja is an unstoppable ninja. Once a ninja takes the potion you'll become an ninja outline and can go through enemies. Nothing can harm you, but that doesn't limit your ability to dispatch foes.<br><br>2.

Bombs: these items look like two speed boost orbs, or the wheels of the cart, however, they are a trap. Jumping into these means instant death for Jajamaru-kun<br><br>12. Trusty Frog: Jajamaru-kun's noble steed, a humongous man-eating frog. Should you collect four power-ups instead of receiving the power of the fourth you will get to ride on your gigantic frog and eat all the enemies on the stage. This can be dangerous though if you have not yet gotten the stages petal as once on the frog it won't show up. There is no time limit on how long the frog stays, unless of course the time runs out entirely before you gobble up all the enemies. Once a stage ends you will have to repeat the item collection process to ride the frog again. Items in your collection carry over between stages so you can strategically pick a fourth on a stage where you need the frog.

You determine their class schedules, do guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend plans, and occasionally take to the streets to make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each of the girls have their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterwards, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.<br><br>Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation.

Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.<br><br>Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)<br><br>In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

Description=Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.<br><br>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...<br><br>Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. <br><br>In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. <br><br>Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.

But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...<br><br>This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.<br><br>The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.

The levelling up is similar to Secret of Mana, where the weapon skill for a character increases at a different rate to the character levels.

Description=Once upon a time, three evil gods fought against the holy gods, and the holy God-Father chose a human warrior to help them. Finally, after a prolonged, terrible war, the leader of the three evil gods - Death, the eldest of them - surrendered. The youngest evil god, Schirach, became a human and has lost her powers. The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.<br><br>Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of three Super Nintendo entries. The first three games in the series were on the Gameboy and were known as "Final Fantasy Legend" outside of Japan. In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from Final Fantasy II on the NES, instead of "Leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike. Which is good considering the steep learning curve of the SaGa games which require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.<br><br>"Romancing SaGa" was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake "Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song"

Description=Although made by  Square, the famous Japanese RPG developer, "Wild Card" is a game that is very different from classic Asian RPGs. Most importantly, it is not story-driven. The game is based entirely on quests which are not connected by a story arc. You play a nameless character with no background and there is no plot information or development beside your own progress with the quests. The gameplay consists entirely of playing cards. In the beginning of the game, an enigmatic woman named Maria asks you a series of questions, to determine the cards you get. After that, your character begins an adventure in a town. Locations, other characters, inventory, your movement - everything appears in form of cards. To get quests, you must choose your correspondent cards when encountering different people. You can buy weapons and equipment, and also fight enemies in turn-based combat by choosing the cards from your deck. You gain levels and become stronger in a traditional RPG fashion.

Description=The first Wizardry game was one of the original CRPG dungeon crawlers, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre. You generate and control a party of up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find treasure.<br><br>The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.
