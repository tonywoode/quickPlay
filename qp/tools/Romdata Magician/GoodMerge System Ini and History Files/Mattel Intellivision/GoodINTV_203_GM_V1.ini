Description=Intellivision Backgammon is identical with the board game. Backgammon is a game played by two players (the computer can be one of the players). Each player has 15 pieces. The object of the game is to be the first to move all your pieces completely around and finally off the board. Moving your pieces off the board is called "bearing off". The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner. Each player moves in a direction beginning from his opponent's Home Table and coming around to his own Home Table. Thus one player always moves clockwise and the other always <br>counterclockwise.<br>You can play against the computer at two skill levels - one for beginners or intermediate, another for experts - or two players can compete against each other. It displays the American Backgammon Players Association (ABPA) logo.

First you need to select a destination which features a lot of targets. The further the target is from your home base, the more points you can earn, but with more ground to cover there will be more enemy fighters blocking the target and more fuel will be needed. Once a destination is set, you need to stock your plane with bombs and fuel, then take off! You will now have a first person point of view from the plane and can control which of several views is active. When trying to bomb targets, you will be looking straight down from the bombay doors. When you hear a voice announce incoming enemy planes, you need to switch the view to one of the guns and defend yourself. Lastly you can have a view from the cockpit to control the plane. If your fuel runs low, or your plane takes too much damage, you can fly back to your home base for repairs and then take off again to bomb as many targets as you can!

The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray cans are destroyed by growing flowers.

Description=Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.

Description=Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Description=Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.<br><br>Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.<br><br>Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.

A fleet of these large battlecraft are now heading towards your home planet, and it is your job to stop them! The game is played from a side scrolling overhead point of view as your small but agile spaceship flies past the dreadnaughts. On each pass your spaceship makes, you need to try and bomb as many of the energy vents as possible. When all energy vents on a dreadnaught are destroyed, that dreadnaught will explode. Time is limited, though, and if you make too many passes to destroy the energy vents the dreadnaught will be within firing range of your home planet and will destroy it. Each of the dreadnaughts are heavily armed; guns, canons, missiles, and other weapons are located on each dreadnaught and will be trying their best to end your mission. Multiple skill levels are included which alter the number of dreadnaughts you must destroy, as well as their speed and firing capabilities.

In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game.  In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.<br><br>In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.<br><br>Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.

Now to save the patient, you control a robot probe which can be used to administer aspirin, antiseptic, or ultrasonics to clear up the problem. You should clear up the most critical conditions first, then move on to the less serious areas to ensure your patient survives. Your probe should navigate through the veins, arteries, and lymph; if you guide the probe outside these areas, it's movement will slow down and swarms of white blood cells will attack it, depleting the limited energy supply. There are 197 different patients you need to help, each with different ailments.

Description=Super Pro Hockey is a one or two-player hockey game.  There are four handicap/skill levels to choose from after selecting whether or not the player wants a one or two-player game: Amateur, Rookie, Pro, Super Pro.  Essentially, changing the handicap results in changing speeds to the gameplay, from low (Amateur) to high (Super Pro).  There are no teams, only Home and Visitor.  <br><br>Each team has three players and a goalie.  The home team is tan and the visitor team is green.  The player can only control one character at at time, and this character is colored lighter than the rest of the player's team.  Goalies are controlled by the computer.<br><br>The game also features a special slap shot button, a penalty box, face-offs, interceptions, and tripping.  <br><br>Tripping is considered a "legal" move if applied to the opponent character with the puck.  Penalties occur when a player trips an opponent character without a puck, and one player will be removed to the penalty box.  The team with the penalized player must now defend for a short time with one less man.  Supposedly, the computer "referee" will only call a penalty about one in three times tripping occurs.<br><br>Various stats are maintained at the top of the screen, including score, penalty time, remaining time and which period the game is currently in.  Periods are shown as bars on the screen rather than numbers--one for first, two for second, three for third.<br><br>The game has been criticized for essentially being little more than the original Intellivision NHL Hockey game with an added single player mode.

The first player to bite off all of his opponents links wins.

Description=Take the role of Flynn in Tron: Solar Sailer, an Intellivoice game based on the movie Tron. Navigate your way through the computer world to find the MCP (Master Computer Program). Overload the MCP to escape the computer world and return to reality!<br><br>Tron: Solar Sailer is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then is to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of &quot;energy bugs&quot; on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.<br><br>If the player makes it to Track 0, stage two begins. The player is placed in the heart of the MCP as it attempts to make continuous data transmissions to keep the player from entering the override code, thereby overloading the MCP and allowing Flynn to escape the computer program. 0s and 1s fly at the player in a first-person view. An in-game voice gives the player the override code in binary, and the player uses a cursor to catch the appropriate bits. Using the number pad, the player can then specify where in the code sequence the captured bit should go. Red bits, when colliding with the cursor, automatically fill in a randomly selected part of the sequence. This area is timed, so the code must be entered as quickly as possible!<br><br>Once the correct sequence has been entered, the MCP overloads and the game is over. However, the game gives the option of going into &quot;Overtime Mode&quot; for extra points, at which point the player attempts to block all incoming transmissions or lose the game.
