Description=The prequel to 1942, like the other games in the 194x series, is a top down shooter set in WWII.<br><br>One or two players control a P-38 (for player 1) or a Mosquito (for player 2), shooting enemy airplanes and ships. As in the previous games, one button shoots the airplane's weapon (which is upgradeable by collecting power ups left by enemies) and the other makes the airplane loop, destroying everything on screen (or causing extra damage to bosses, fought at the end of each level). The regular ammo is infinite, while the upgraded weapons have limited ammo. When the weapon button is held down, a bar at the bottom of the screen is charged and a special shot can be released, which varies in effect from weapon to weapon.<br><br>The airplane has a life bar which starts with three points. Each hit taken or loop used will consume one life point. The player will earn new life points at the end of levels or by collecting proper power ups. Other power ups available are auxiliary side and ghost airplanes. Three continues can be used, and one point is added to the score when one of them is used (a feature first introduced by this game and then copied by other shoot-em-ups).

While Air Zonk differed from its successor in terms of gameplay, the cartoonish style of the Bonk series could still be seen all throughout the game, especially in the graphics, the characters, & of course, Zonk himself.<br><br>Air Zonk may appear to feature a candy cartoon coating on the outside, but it's still a traditional shoot-'em-up at heart. You still have a selection of your basic weapon power-ups (8 in total here), but spread guns & powerful bursts are now represented by killer decks of cards & giant metal mandibles. Large, imposing endbosses are still the norm, but here your foes range from giant heaps of living garbage to killer football players. And outer space? Who needs to blow up things there when you have other venues (5 in total) such as a gigantic stadium to do it in?<br><br>In addition to all of this, Air Zonk gives you a feature that allows you to choose from one of 10 "friends" at the beginning of each level who will fight by your side once you pick up a certain power-up. These friends range from giant scud missiles to living dump trucks to floating cow-things, among others. Pick up another power-up, & Zonk & his friend combine to create a powerful hybrid form, featuring some of the strangest attacks you may ever see in a video game.<br><br>So will Zonk be able to defeat King Drool, rescue the moon from his clutches, & save the world? As usual, the answer is up to you...

Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early  Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as &quot;Talk&quot; or &quot;Search&quot;, rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.

Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs.<br><br>If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an "inactive" state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it "active".

In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.

The player navigates Ryo through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is rather simple, without power-ups or different weapons, and with one items possible to carry at a time. The levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game also reveals mild adventure elements: often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.

Description=Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.<br><br>As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.

The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.

You can begin with 1 ship with 2 in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve).  <br><br>Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. <br>Some enemies explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen.  Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. <br><br>Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. <br><br>In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.

Regular enemies pop out randomly, and must be defeated in a very simple turn-based combat. <br><br>There is no damage feedback for the hero (though the player can see exactly how badly the hero himself is hurt), no weapons, armor, or items for combat usage. The player can heal the hero's wounds by selecting "sleep" from the menu. Sleeping restores the hero to full HP; but if he rests too much, a tough demon will appear and attack.<br><br>Character growth is handled via direct stat increasing; there are no "levels", and the hero's HP, attack and defense power, as well as agility, increase gradually the more he fights.<br><br>On each floor, a digitized photo of a young woman will greet the hero and encourage the player to explore further - at the stairs to the next floor, should the hero overcome all the obstacles, the player will be able to see the girl naked.

There is also a "search" command in the game, which is required to use to solve certain situations.

Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability.<br><br>When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there's no extra time whatsoever.<br><br>In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.

Description=You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?<br><br>Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. <br><br>You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. <br><br>Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.

Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points.<br><br>A somewhat unusual feature is "double leveling": the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.

Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)<br><br>The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or ranged weapons. Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area.<br><br>Enemies leave orbs of various colors and chests upon defeat; these serve to heal Laila, grant her experience points, "mind points", or ammunition for the firearms. Laila starts with a knife and a pistol, but later gains access to more powerful firearms. These weapons can be enhanced with Laila's psychic techniques, which, in their turn, require mind points.

Having returned to his normal self, Susa has to find his sweetheart Yukishiro and other friends, and figure out a way to undo the damage he has inflicted on the world.<br><br>Susanoo Densetsu is notable for implementing a setting and gameplay themes unusual for Japanese RPGs of its time. Among those is a day/night cycle, which influences the appearance of monsters on the world map as well as schedules of characters in the towns (for example, shops are closed at night). It is also one of the first Japanese RPGs in which enemies wander around visibly on the world map, sometimes surrounding the player,  Ultima-style, and can be avoided.<br><br>The battle system is also reminiscent of Ultima, featuring free movement on the top-down battle screen. The fights are held in fast-paced turn-based style; to pause the fight, the player has to bring up the menu and select a command. Similarly to  Emerald Dragon, action points are spent when moving and/or selecting commands.<br><br>Later in the game Susa teams up with two other characters; he can also recruit mercenaries to help him in battles. Characters learn the so-called "ESP powers" when leveling up, which are equivalent to magic spells.

The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.<br><br>The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it.

These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. <br><br>Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. <br><br>In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.
