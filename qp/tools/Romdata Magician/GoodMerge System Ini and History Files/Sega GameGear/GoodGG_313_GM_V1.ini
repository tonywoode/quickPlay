As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. <br><br>There are three main modes:<br><br>1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps. <br><br>2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. <br><br>3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).<br><br>While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers.

Description=Sega's 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis' popular Disney platformer. Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.<br><br>To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.<br><br>Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.

Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.<br><br>As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks.

On one of thirty different maps, units are produced and moved out into combat, and the war is only over when the enemy capital has been conquered.<br><br>Three basic phases make up each turn: production, movement and combat. Each city or airbase within a distance of five hexagons from your capital may produce one unit each turn, as long as your funds allow it. Each turn yields new funds, whose amount is proportional to the number of cities and airports you have occupied.<br><br>Units are moved on the map, which is based on "fake hexagons"; the hexagons are in fact square, but offset on each row so that each square borders six other squares. Each terrain type has different movement and defence values, which makes movement and combat more complicated.<br><br>The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types, and by their experience. Each time a unit survives combat, it gains experience points and eventually gains in experience level, which makes the chance of winning in combat higher. As each unit is in fact a squadron of ten, a typical combat will only destroy a certain number of the members of the unit.<br><br>An additional moment in the gameplay is the recharging phase. Units which have lost members can be built up to full force in a city or airbase, and those which have run out of ammunition can do the same. Ammunition can also be replenished in the battlefield using supply trucks.<br><br>A total of thirteen airbourne and land-based units are available. Some units cannot fight other units; tanks can do nothing against bombers, and mechanised infantry can't protect itself well against a howitzer two squares away.<br><br>The game can be played both against the computer or against another human player by linking two Game Gears together.

Description=Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.

The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view ("through his eyes").<br><br>Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.<br><br>The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

Rounds one and three are played in Switch Mode: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in Bridge Mode: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.<br><br>If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease.

The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.

While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. <br><br>In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.

The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.<br><br>Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.<br><br>Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.

Description=Head Buster is a so-called future sports game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.<br><br>Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.<br><br>Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.

Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.<br><br>The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.

Description=The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega's taste in motifs.<br><br>As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.<br><br>The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:<br><br>Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.

The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.<br><br>These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.<br><br>Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.<br><br>The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

Description=Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.<br><br>Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.<br><br>Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.

You may also be asked to do a "rensa", or chain reaction, in a certain number of steps. A "rensa" is arranged by making so that if one set of four or more Puyos is eliminated, it will make neighbouring Puyos fall so that new combinations arise, and are eliminated. The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by the fact that you are given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with.<br><br>The game has also an edit mode, where you can make your own puzzles given all the options described above.

Luckily, she can see what Puyos are available for several drop in advance. If she fails to solve a puzzle, Arle can retry, but for each failure, she will lose health. Solving a puzzle makes her level up through the same system used in Mado Monogatari, with a ring of lights around the screen. Raising a level restores health. Will Arle ever be able to cook her curry?<br><br>The game also contains a "Toko Puyo" mode, which is the endless mode known from most regular Puyo Puyo games.

In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.<br>Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.<br><br>The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot.

Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office.

Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. <br><br>Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

Description=Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.<br><br>The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.<br><br>Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.<br><br>The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.<br><br>All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.

This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.<br><br>By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.

In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.<br><br>There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.<br><br>Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.<br><br>At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.

Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.<br><br>Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084.

Enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik.<br><br>Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.

Description=The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.<br><br>There are two game modes building on this basic concept:<br><br>1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.<br><br>Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.

The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.<br><br>On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.<br><br>Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.<br><br>The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.<br>Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

One year later, after their reunion, Adam's brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...<br><br>Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.

Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.<br><br>Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.

Description=Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.<br><br>The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.<br><br>Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. <br><br>The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

Description=Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.<br><br>In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.<br><br>The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.<br><br>The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.<br><br>In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.

You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.<br><br>There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.<br><br>There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.

Description=Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.<br><br>With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind  instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.<br><br>Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.<br><br>Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.

However, after completing level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights.

Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.<br><br>Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).<br><br>The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.

Description=The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.<br><br>Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.<br>In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.

Description=Mister Greede, a corrupt tycoon and factory owner, deprives the local citizens of the goods they need and deserve. Thats why you have infiltrated his factory. Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too long.<br><br>Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in Switch Mode: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in Bridge Mode: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.<br><br>If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.

That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.<br><br>There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.<br><br>There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.
