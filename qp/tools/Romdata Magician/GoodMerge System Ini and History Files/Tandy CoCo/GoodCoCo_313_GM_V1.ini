Description=This is a racquetball-like game that is best described as a 3D variation of Breakout.<br><br>You are at the end on a rectangular room. On the other end is a wall made of bricks or blocks. The ball travels down to the wall and knocks out a brick. It then returns to your end where you must use a squarish paddle to send the ball back to the wall. If the ball gets past the paddle, you lose a ball.<br><br>In the computer version, you must knock out all the bricks of the wall to advance. Each level has more bricks per wall. You begin with 5 balls.<br>In the console version, you must knock out 57 of the 72 bricks to advance. Each level has 72 bricks but the number of balls will lower in later levels. Level 1 starts with 99 balls.

Description=Android Attack is a 32 K update of the Berzerk clone Robot Battle for 16K Tandy Colour systems. The extra memory is used to add in another feature of the original arcade game, namely speech, which is portrayed in its Microdeal title, Talking Android Attack.<br><br>As in Berzerk, you are a lone humanoid in a large complex with lots of maze-like rooms. Your objective is to survive, and earn points by exterminating all the hostile robots that inhabit the complex. Shooting a robot (before it shoots you) turns it into a heap of deadly scrap, which will reanimate after a short while, though not into the android it once was, but into a ghost. The ghosts can pass through walls and try to fulfill the mission of their former life. This is a slight deviation from the original Berzerk, where the ghost was a separate character called "Evil Otto". Another difference is that in this version, you can jump and duck to avoid robot bullets.<br><br>Another peril in the game is the walls, which are electrified. By sacrificing an energy unit, of which you need at least three, you can opening up a hole in the wall to pass through. On each screen there is also a crown, which can be picked up for 100 points. Killing an android gives 50 points, and killing its ghost gives you another 100. By eliminating all enemies and picking up the crown and exiting the room, you are granted a bonus sum calculated from the remaining time (when it reaches zero, you are killed). For every 10 000 points, you earn another energy unit. If you leave the room without having killed the enemies, the computer will say in wobbly 6-bit speech, "Coward!".

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Description=Astroblast is a plain space shoot'em'up, a clone of the arcade game Astro Fighter, which evolved only slightly from the original Space Invaders. Just like in that game, your spaceship must shoot down slowly advancing rows of aliens, and with only one shot on screen at a time. The movement patterns are not yet evolved into something like Galaxian, since the enemies will never swoop down at you, instead moving in formation, but still slightly more advanced than Space Invaders, since they make small lopping patterns to make targeting more difficult. Of course, the barriers of Space Invaders are done away with, since this takes place in space.<br><br>Your spaceship has only one life, but three bars on its shield, which yields much the same result as three lives. What sets Astroblast apart is the small amount of fuel that your ship has, and which can only be refilled every fourth level. You must therefore shoot down all aliens as quickly as possible, or you will run out of fuel before you reach the refueling level.

Description=You are a robber, whose goal is to collect bags of money in each of the three scenes and dump them in your wheelbarrow, while avoiding miners and moving railcars. You can deal with the miners by using a pickaxe to knock them unconscious for a few seconds. If you are trying collect a money bag but a railcar gets in your way, you can cling onto the ceiling while it passes by. If you drop off the handholds on the ceiling at the right time, you can also ride the railcar to avoid the miners.<br><br>Once you do collect all the bags of money in one scene, you simply move your wheelbarrow to the next scene. In fact, you can go between the 3 scenes at will; you do not have to collect all the money bags in one scene in order to proceed to the next. In the last two scenes, you have to use elevators to get from Point A to Point B. Be warned: you can only carry one money bag at a time, and the weight of the bag makes you move slowly, making it a lot easier for miners to catch you. Also remember that time is against you, but if you manage to dump a bag in the wheelbarrow, you are given more time.<br>    There is a special money bag (worth more points) inside a blocked off room, in the middle screen. You need the pickaxe to break through the wall to get it, but it is very heavy, and slows you down much more than a regular money bag.

A queue of Cuthberts wait to be rescued from the mine, which means climbing up through several levels of rails with ore wagons before reaching the surface. This can be described as similar to the road in Frogger in gameplay, but is complicated by the ladder on which Satan himself climbs back and forth, firing a bolt of fire at Cuthbert whenever he finds himself at the same layer. Being hit by the fire means that Cuthbert is sent falling to a certain death in the flaming pits of hell which is found beneath the rails. Being hit by a rail car, on the other hand, simply means that he is sent back to a lower rail. If he is hit by another wagon there, the procedure is repeated, until he eventually winds up in the flames anyway. The line of Cuthberts is seemingly infinite, but after five are killed, it's game over. As they reach the surface, the skill level is raised, which means that the cars go at a faster pace and with smaller gaps between them.

You must not let your trigger finger rest here, because the robots will try to walk down beside you where you cannot hit them with your bullets.<br>The sproings level feature enemies who jump up and down on the screen. Let them not jump into you.<br><br>Like many other primitive shoot'em'ups (though this one is otherwise much less primitive than many others), you have only one bullet on screen at any time, and it follows your ship to the left and right. This turns out to be a major part of the gameplay, since it alters the way you calculate the right moment to fire and even lets you criss-cross your bullet between enemies in order to hit those higher up.

Description=Donkey King is one of those shameless Donkey Kong clones, for systems that never received an official port. For those that don't know Nintendo's original, it is the first game where Mario appears, and one of the earliest platformers. On each level, high up on a building site, Mario must climb his way up to the big ape and free a damsel in distress. The giant ape throws obstacles which Mario must avoid, in addition to the hostile environment containing fires and conveyor belts. Donkey King has all the stages of the original Donkey Kong, known here as the Barrels, Pins, Jacks and Conveyor screens. It has even retained the cut scenes and the hair style of Mario's beloved.<br><br>A feature unique to this version is the option to play in three different colour modes: green, buff or black and white.

Description=Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.<br><br>Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

A baddie in the centre of the screen will spawn a new baddie every time the running meter on the score panel has reached zero.<br><br>The powerup system does not work like Pac-Man, though. No invincibility pills are available, instead, there are a number of letters from the words "special" and "extra" displayed at the top of the screen. When the letters are the same colour as the words they belong to, you begin to spell out those words, granting you either a "special" round or an "extra" life. Additionally, the heart bonuses act as score multipliers for your pills.<br><br>Without any power pills, your bug is quite vulnerable. Therefore, the environment must be used to its advantage. Many walls in the Doddle Bug maze function like revolving doors which, when passed, will rotate to block the path of a baddie that could otherwise hunt you down.

It contained 5 levels of dungeon to explore, and more and more powerful monsters the deeper you got (some monsters of the same type get more powerful as well, the deeper you got... for example, the troll starts on level one armed with a club, but on later levels he gets more powerful with an axe).<br>   Some of the innovations (for it's time) that made it rank higher than most dungeon crawls were: different levels of torches, that actually changed how far ahead you can see (and wear out, so everything gets dimmer and dimmer); monsters that each generated different sounds, and whose sounds grew louder or fainter as the monsters moved relative to you (even if you couldn't see them behind walls); and the real-time aspect of the heartbeat. If you were getting injured, or running too fast, your heart rate increased, and if you pushed it too far, you would pass out. Of course, while passed out, monsters keep moving and attacking...

Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.<br><br>This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. <br><br>The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.<br><br>Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

In this implementation, the board can be reduced as small as 9x9. When playing against the computer, you can choose from eight levels of difficulty, move first or second (which defines your play in both games), switch sides, get a hint, take back any number of moves, review an entire game step-by-step, and watch the computer "think" or even play itself. Play against another human is possible, too, but the opening-move restrictions of Renju are left to you to enforce.

Description=Junior's Revenge is a feature-complete clone of Donkey Kong Jr.. All four stages of the original are present.<br><br>Junior, son of a monkey, must free his father from the evil Luigi (this was right before Mario Bros was released, so the naming of the character was an effort to avoid infringing on Mario, even though the name wound up being used for his brother straight thereafter). This he must do by climbing up and down vines and jumping between platforms, avoiding the fish-like creatures that run up and down the vines. On later screens, he must climb chains to push locks into position so that the cage holding his father is opened. Fruits can be found hanging on the vines and chains, which can be picked up for points, upon which they drop, eliminating any enemies unfortunate enough to be positioned underneath.<br><br>The game runs in artifact mode on Tandy computers, and with the usual three colour selections on a Dragon.

Description=This is a collection of three mini-games designed to drill in some basic reading and typing skills to the young microcomputer user of the early '80s.  The first of the three games (each with four skill levels, demanding faster reflexes) presents the player with falling letters which must be typed correctly before hitting the bottom of the screen... and eventually the game's mascot floats down defying the player to type in an entire word.  The second game takes word-typing as a given skill, as the player is now in charge of typing in the full names of icons of common household objects gradually floating down the screen.  In the third game, an object is named on the bottom of the screen and the player must punch in the correct number corresponding to the object's icon, displayed on screen.<br><br>The second and third games have bonus rounds whose gameplay is as the regular rounds, except that the icons are now partially obscured, demanding a certain exercise of player memory faculties.

The Terran Federation is locked in a deadly war with "the Bugs," and has announced "Operation Bughouse," an attack directly on the Bugs' home world of Klendathu.  Equipped with a state-of-the-art power suit, you drop in from orbit and and torch as many Bug warriors as possible, then bounce back out before your suit runs out of energy or the Bugs overwhelm you.  Survive three drops and you can retire, with pay based on how many Bugs of each rank you blasted.<br><br>Game play consists of carefully selecting which block of the drop zone to land in, and then blasting the warrior and queen Bugs as they advance down the screen toward you.  For each warrior and queen you might see, however, there are many more harmless worker Bugs, which look exactly like the warriors.  They're all swarming toward you; choose your targets carefully and don't waste your ammo.    You'll know the warriors because they're the ones shooting at you.

Your job is made harder by the size of the maze (20x20), which requires a magnifier over your location to show the action, effectively creating a blind spot at a radius of three dots around you.  To succeed, you must watch not only where you're going, but scan each randomly generated maze to plan your route and avoid the Mega-Bugs.  If you do succeed, you're rewarded with a new maze and an additional Mega-Bug hunting you.

The pieces come out of the first conveyor belt in random order, and you can only carry one piece at a time. If you accidentally assemble a product in the wrong order, it becomes useless, so you have to careful where you drop the pieces. There is also a Panic Button (hence the game name) in the upper right corner that you can hit that stops the conveyor belts temporarily.<br>For each level, you have to make a specific amount of the product you are creating within a time limit of 2 minutes, and each successive level gets faster and faster (and you also have to build more and more). Also, since the 3 conveyor belts are staggered, and pieces will drop on their own between them, you have to be careful watching them as they get near a drop point, as they could fall on pieces you have already constructed and potentially screw that particular product up. On later levels, the bad products start bouncing around as well, interfering with your manoeuvring.

When you begin the game, you can select whether you want a simple maze, with lots of long hallways, or a complex maze, with lots or turns and dead ends. When you find a phantom, you shoot it. Once you kill a phantom, it regenerates in a random location in the maze. Each time you kill a phantom, they will then require more shots to kill. Also, in the maze, is a randomly placed teleport square that will charge you and place you in the center of the maze as well as briefly show you a map of the maze, including the phantoms. The teleport square regenerates after it is used.

There's three levels of ever-increasing difficulty on your quest to rescue Carol-Anne.<br><br>The first level is a top-down view of the neighbourhood where you must search nearby homes for these items: a length of rope, a ribbon, a towel, some tennis balls, and a handkerchief.  A black dot on a house indicates where they are and you only have a limited 30 time units to accomplish this.  You must avoid speeding cars on the streets by ducking into driveways and avoid the poltergeist who will randomly go from house to house (seen as a flashing box).  Once all the items are acquired, you enter the the house where the poltergeist is.  <br><br>In the second level, you are shown a view of a stairway going upward and on each step there are barriers moving horizontally - squares and ovals with X's through them.   You (as a pair of shoe prints) must move up or down, left or right, to avoid all obstacles until you reach the top where the steps get narrower and more difficult.  Meanwhile a poltergeist will also be chasing you up the stairs so you must be quick before the 30 time units are up.<br><br>In the third and final level, you enter the closet and from a first-person view must shoot a firearm and hit 8 poltergeists but beware as Carol-Anne is also there and if you hit her, you will go all the way back to the first level again.  If you manage to complete it, you will receive the message "This house is clean".

Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.<br><br>The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)<br><br>The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.

Each hit by an enemy blast reduces your power and briefly scrambles your view.  Four levels of play culminate in a campaign where you jump from sector to sector eradicating enemy ships in dogfights with up to four opponents. A Long Range Sensor screen shows the status of your ship's various systems, how many enemies are in each sector, and where to find space stations.  To be recharged and repaired, you carefully maneuver your ship to the correct position and speed to receive a power pack from the space station.

Description=An arcade style game with a loose basis on the arcade hit Defender, Protector II is a side-scrolling shooter. Like Defender, there are lots of different aliens to contend with, and some ground based enemies as well. There are no smart bombs, however. You have to rescue humans as well (twice) from both an alien ship, and later a city that will be overrun with lava from a volcano that erupts during the game; all the while protecting them from aliens. You then have to drop them one at a time (unlike Defender, you can only carry one human at a time) into a teleporter tube to get them off the planet entirely.<br>   The game is quite difficult, with some very precise flying required at times (probably even more difficult than Defender or Stargate). It also has more of a &quot;plot&quot; than the arcade games it is based on, with several sub-missions of rescue depending on what stage you are at (it should be noted that there is no breaks between &quot;stages&quot; - the whole game play is continuous).

Description=The latest breakthrough in nuclear power is broken. It's the network, of course. In the dazzling future of the late 1990's, the world's first fusion reactor is online: energy particles are shooting out of emission tubes toward the energy posts... and missing. As each one passes the posts and strikes another tube on the opposite side of the core, the reactor moves one step closer to meltdown. The reflectoid is there; that's the solid energy deflection device which bounces the particles into the posts. It's supposed be remotely controlled by a sophisticated network of computers, but tonight it has to be controlled by you!<br><br>Reactoid gives you a top-down view of the reactor core, the heart of Professor Albert Arnstein's experimental and top-secret power station. Twenty-four energy posts are at the center, surrounded by twenty particle emission tubes, any one of which could emit the next energy particle. You generate kilowatts (your score) by deflecting the particle into a post as it passes one. There's only one chance to get it right; after the first bounce off the reflectoid, the particle will just pass through it on a second attempt. If seven of those particles find their way to another emission tube, whether by shooting across the core undeflected or by your inept deflection, meltdown is reached. On the other hand, if you deflect particles into all of the posts, lighting them, you survive the round and are rewarded with a fresh start and two particles shooting across the core at a time. For each round you survive, the particles on the screen and the kilowatt multiplier increase. Three meltdowns and you're done, unless you've picked up a spare reflectoid along the way.

The complex has a very strong radiation field, which means you must keep on moving unless you want to die just from ambient radiation.<br><br>You carry a beam weapon, whose beam can extend across the entire screen. The longer you fire it, though, you expose yourself to more radiation. Use the weapon to destroy turrets and power generators which sustain force fields which block your way. Different hostile creatures will also patrol the complex and try to kill you. At certain locations, you are unable to use your gun. Beside that, the main component of the game is to use the platforms and lifts to get to the right place where you can shut off a generator so that you can reach the next generator whose forcefield shuts your path to your mates off.<br><br>At the end of each level, the radiation you have absorbed is removed, and you receive one of the aliens' secret TRG-5 attack saucer sub-assemblies which must be brought back to your allies.

Description=This game is an early simulation of NASA's space shuttle, on a mission to retrieve a failed satellite. Most of the controls are handled using the joystick. The mission is comprised of five different stages:<br><br>1. Launch: After an automatic lift-off out of Earth's gravity, you guide the shuttle to a rendezvous point.<br>Park: With the satellite in sight, approach it until you are right next to it.<br>Arm: Use the robot arm to catch the floating satellite and bring it into the cargo space of the shuttle.<br>Entry: Just like the launch stage, but without throttle control, you guide the shuttle to a target box indicated in the plotter instrument.<br>Final approach: From an outside view of the shuttle, try to decelerate at the same time as dropping to an altitude of zero.<br><br>The main view is from the cockpit, with a small stripe in the centre dedicated to the outside view, and the rest comprised of instruments and indicators. All of these instruments, indicating the stages of the mission, the attitude of the craft and its course, as well as altitude and speed, are functional. Certain parts of the mission are moved to an outside view for pædagogical reasons. To make the game more beginner-friendly, the mission is not aborted if a certain stage is not fulfilled, but points are awarded for how well each stage is completed.

Donkey King).<br><br>One of the most cloned games must be Konami's Scramble, and a staggering number of those clones were called Skramble with a K. This version of Skramble is Microdeal's rendition for the Dragon 32 and Tandy Colour.<br><br>Apart from the obvious hardware limitations, this is a rather faithful copy of the original shooter. you fly your spaceship through a cave system (split up on five sections) filled with missiles that launch from the ground, radar installations and disturbing objects that fly in your path. Destroy them with your bombs and forward-mounted gun. All the while, you must keep track of your fuel level. Bomb fuel silos on the ground to fill up.

Fuel, upkeep, and even computer access contribute to overhead expenses.  Pirates will get in your way and do costly damage to your ship or even end your career if your aim is slow.  When money runs short, however, you can always scoop fuel from a red giant star or swipe some cargo from the ship a few bays down.  If you make your deliveries on time, your reputation will bring you better fees.<br><br>The emphasis of the game is economic; ship-to-ship combat is purely a gallery shoot with moving targets and a possibility of escape.  All play is real-time, so even in the starport, your fuel is being used and delivery dates are getting closer.  Care must be taken in selecting cargo, as some runs will lose you money for the amount of fuel they consume.  Run out of fuel in mid-jump and you're space salvage.

From the far end of the tunnel come coloured bars of various colours. Moving around the tunnel's mouth, you shoot the bars until you reach a set score, which will promote you to the next level. With only 99 shots granted on each level, it is better to let the bars reach the end of the tunnel than to miss them with your gun. One kind of bar that should not be missed, though, is the orange kind, called ”Millibars”. These will, if they reach the edge of the tunnel, chase you around. After a while, the Millibars will disappear, but if more than one has reached the edge where you are, avoiding them long enough can be very difficult. The game becomes gradually more difficult as you progress through the levels, and on later levels, the tunnel itself is no longer shown.

It is a maze, and there is activity. Two million years ago a society steeped in wealth and the magic occupied the planet. Legend has it that they left behind a curse protecting their temples and the valuable artifacts contained within. Your purpose is "to enrich the present by expanding our knowledge of the experiences and achievements of this past civilization."<br><br>In game terms, this means blasting monsters and collecting treasure -- what else? Poisonous spiders and sentient fireballs occupy the rooms of the temple, while giant bats patrol overhead, swooping down when they spot you. Enticing you onward are golden cups, jade crosses, diamond rings, crystal goblets, and silver pitchers. Magical treasures such as crystal balls and golden crowns will for a time render you invisible and boost your laser, respectively.<br><br>No small challenge is the maze itself, eerily reminiscent of a colossal computer chip. You have an overhead view, but only of a small portion, and it doesn't scroll until you're near the edge. The result is that while moving into new territory, you see only a half-dozen paces ahead. There are a few pairs of transfer portals, which will zap you across the maze, but as often with archeology, your investigation relies on legwork. The maze, occupants, and treasures are constant each play, so over time you can come to know the temple well, and your laser very well.<br><br>The scroll? That's the instructions in the game manual.

Description=Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.<br><br>Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.<br><br>Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).<br><br>Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. <br><br>Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.

The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen Treasures of Zork. <br><br>As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" command (or just "i"). <br><br>Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the '80s.
