// This inc file depends on jedi.inc which has to
// be included first (usually indirectly through
// the inclusion of jvcl.inc).

// Do not suppress platform warnings to avoid problems
// with an including unit which is not cross platform.
// To suppress these warnings one of the inc files
// windowsonly.inc, linuxonly.inc or crossplatform.inc
// has to be included also.

// Cause a compilation error for any component library except Visual CLX.
